Thought it means Global Positioning System. There are two precision levels, one  
for army applications (killing has to be very accurate today) and one for civil  
ones. The civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if I'm wrong),  
though, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings. But there is a way with  
an additional reference point (e.g. one fixed GPS system in a house) to get the  
same high precision as the military version, but it gets pretty complicated  
then. If You use a microwave system (actually this means some type of radar),  
You need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of  
Your original signals. So the GPS system seems to be the better (and running)  
idea for Your application(there have been discussions in this newsgroup, don't  
know of an address anymore).

Subject: Xmas light set with 2 levels of brightness

Another version of a variable brightness Xmas light set:
This set starts with a 2 blinker 35 bulb string.  

DIAGRAM:  orginal 2 way set

120v---+--b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!
       !---b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!
                           !
120rtn_____________________!

modified set for 2 level brightness:

                string 1
120v---------*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!
  \_10K_______*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!
    5w    !      string 2     !
          b   ________________!
120v rtn__!___!

             ^ Note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.

Only one blinker is used.

Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the
string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in
parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor
here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the
current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing
and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,
this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the
strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  
Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get
one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these
draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.

What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light 
at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current 
from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing 
both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a 
low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow 
at reduced brightness. 

Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires 
in a safe manner!

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in
any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference
power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which
should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms
in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted
notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*
(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.
So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation
such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.

For power:

  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )

For amplitude

  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )

'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.
It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for
the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation
convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.

Common references for audio are:

	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms
	0 dBV = 1 volt

	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)
	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)


Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
or moment.

Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear
impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the
power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done
with the above two identities and ohm's law.

... Wouldn't a crystal be affected by cold? My gut feeling is that, as a
mechanically resonating device, extreme cold is likely to affect the
compliance (?terminology?) of the quartz, and hence its resonant frequency.

The HC711 is an EPROM version of the HC11. Raw HC11 parts have factory set
ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have
EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.

Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user
programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The
more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip
varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing
the EPROM array to light.

The Federal Communications Act of 1934 made it *legal* for you to
operate a radio receiver of any kind, on any frequency (including
X, K, and Ka bands) in the United States.  The Electronic
Communications Privacy Act of 1989(?) restricted the FCA of 1934
by making it illegal to receive the land-mobile telephone service,
including (I believe) cellular phones.  No restriction was placed
on receiving RADAR (or, curiously, cordless phones.)  Enforcement
of the Virginia law is in violation of the FCA of 1934.  If you have
lots of time and money (and a lawyer, which I'm *not*,) you can
argue this in a federal court and try to have the law overturned.

I can hardly wait to see the responses to this one, but somebody

Heh, heh, heh, heh....I laugh because I have the same damn TV, and it
did the same thing!  Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the
same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.

#1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs want
to make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll 
*implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the
glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In any
case, don't kick it around! :-) 

#2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned
out to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guess
the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it
created, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't
shorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying
around that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see it
being more than 50 cents!.

Well, needless to say, the TV still works today.  So go get a set of
schematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking around
the flyback.

Ok lets have some calculation here: Going by Australian standards, which I

input) a phone uses 600ohm to loop a 48V line = 80mA. A standard LED 
drains 20mA. So what is the actual loop current required for an ""off hook"" 
indication, do you know?

You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in
front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).
My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.

Good UV (""blacklight"") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs.  I'd proceed by
getting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an
electrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it.

Hi,

	Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under
my belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp. So, 
I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!

	Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No,
Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:

	Ai [Current Gain]
	Av [Voltage Gain]
	Ap [Power Gain]
	or whatever.

I already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, but
I would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the parts
list has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin? 
SIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 mag
so it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement in
the latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I could
figure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas? 

	I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp 
models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for High
power amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than
I started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet
good gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this 
E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me? 

I'm open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help!
Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News... 
And I'll post if there's and interest!
John

Great Explaination, however you left off one detail, why do you always
see them at nuclear plants, but not always at fossil fuel plants.  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many
fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination.

Good point...also, I wouldn't be surprised that the components
they use off-shore are of inferior quality.  As long as it was
properly designed and robust, premium components are used, it
shouldn't matter where it is assembled.

An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound.
The amp you have probably is running Class-A the whole day.

Actually, I'd be wary of excessively hot amps, 'cauz even though
the components inside may be rated to run that way, excessive 
heat will dramatically shorten the life of *any* electronic component
regardless of quality.  In fact, an amp that does run hot to the touch is
because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs!  Hmmmmm....

Wow, what a concept!  Does anybody want to speculate on how this
""non-connection"" would fit into the theft of cable services laws?
It seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into
the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to
stand upon in court.

Does anybody out there have any specific legal knowledge on this?

In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces
on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps,
the following temperature rises versus width.  This is from Sams'
""Reference Data for Engineers,"" seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims
in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...

    width   Temp rise
    inches  degrees C
    ------  ---------
     .125	100
     .15	 75
     .17	 60
     .20	 45
     .24	 30
     .33	 20

At 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees.
Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes
up as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20"" (~5mm) traces should be 
ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the 
required width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08"" width myself, 
I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is
a transient or fault condition.)

(There's another question: will the voltage drop be low enough?
But you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or
just the resistivity of copper.  Keep traces short and use separate
sensing traces where appropriate, as mentioned by another poster.)

Bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas LaserJets (given half-way decent
toner, like HP's ""Microfine"" stuff) don't.  Both produce very good output,
but you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet
output is definitely superior.  

On the other hand, LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and use
the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much
worse than a bubblejet. :-)

One other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are BubbleJets.
There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output
(such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet), whereas most produce really good
looking output (such as HP's DeskJets).  IBM and Canon both produce some of
the really good style bubblejets.

					---Joel Kolstad

P.S. -- If you're in the market for a portable bublejet printer, I can
highly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet, although I've heard the portable
Canons are good too (I needed PCL support, myself).  With the DeskJet
Portable, you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot!

Just a shot here, but ya never know:

I once bought a (REAL) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player 
at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.  For a 
while, that is.  Then one channel quit entirely.  I opened it up, and the 
amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder 
joints attaching it to the PCB.  I soldered them back and it worked fine.  
I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably 
lousy heat sinking.

During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
to melt. When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
tower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.
There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.

Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companies
are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the
raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attack
by lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the property
rather than the edge of the cooling tower. Eliminating this law will save
power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.

Since your MOSFET is a 1972 vintage, it's probably not a very good one by 
today's standards.  If you have an idea about its voltage and current 
ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with 
anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating 
of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely ""ON"" 
at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or 
less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is 
used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to 
experiment with various gain-altering techniques.

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for
antenna simulation, particularly in source form suitable for Unix workstations
(though good PC software would also be of interest).
I'm aware of the numerous mininec mutations, and have been using MN for
some time now.  I'm primarily interested in HF, VHF, and low UHF (< 500 MHz)
designs, mostly wire antennas, but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well
as for your basic thin wire assumption.
Is anything interesting happening with NEC itself?  I've seen a version
that was mutilated to run (sort of) under Microsoft Fortran, but I'm not
sure how many ""new and improved"" versions of the code might be out there
somewhere.
I'd also be interested in non-NEC derivatives.  The ones I've seen have
been aimed at microwave applications, but if there is something out there
useful at the lower frequencies, I'd like to know about it.

Pardon me, but why would carbon-zinc cells have any lead in them at all.

Does anyone know what frequencies the wireless transmitter/receiver
microphone systems that Radio Shack sells operate at?  I've tried
everything short of opening one up (not actually owning one makes
this difficult...) and just looking..  Any help would be greatly
appreciated..  These systems are designed for wireless PA systems, etc..

part of the memory is used as a ""function table"", then
""looking up"" a value of that function for a value of the 
variable which is obtained in the course of the computation
requires that the machine itself should modify, or
rather make up, the reference to the memory in the order which
controls this ""looking up"", and the machine can only make this
modification after it has already calculated the value of the 
variable in question.
	On the other hand, this ability of the machine to modify its

the non-trivial operation which we have to view it as.""

Digi-Key also sells Quad Line Receivers, parts DS1489AN (68cents) and DS1489N
(48cents).  A Quad Line Driver, part DS1488 (48cents), is also sold.  I guess
if you don't won't to supply +12V, the chips with the pump-up circuitry might
be worth the extra cost.  But 1488's and 1489's are available at your friendly
neighborhood RS, parts MC1488 (276-2520) for $1.29 and MC1489 (276-2521) for
$1.29.

There is a number you can call which will return a synthesized
voice telling you the number of the line.  Unfortunately, for the
life of me I can't remember what it is. The telephone technicians
use it all the time.  We used to play around with this in our
dorm rooms since there were multiple phone lines running between
rooms.

	Yes there is.  Not common for CB.  The pattern is different (sort of
	a cloverleaf, with four main lobes.

> The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by 1/4, then 1/8 etc.
	Use of anything under 1/4 wave for transmitting is very uncommon.  (The
	usual ""rubber duck"" uses a coil to fool itself into looking like a
	quarter wave.
	I reccomend the ARRL Antenna Handbook, or a good basic book.

The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series
can handle twice the output voltage. Sometimes two elco's in antiseries
(you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large
capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.

So there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost
one.

I hate to disagree w/ a fellow as smart as Henry, but...

A few years back, I worked on a project using lots of high-speed
stuff.  (My part was slow & parallel, whew.) The mild-mannered designer
working on the fast (serial) stuff cussed & swore at 74F all the time.
It was the Harry Reams of TTL. One ultra-tiny power line glitch, one
hickup, one eyeblink across the board, and bang - the F had
toggled/counted/whatevered.  At times he swore it would count even
without any 5 volt supply ;-} You can guess what the ""F"" stood for....

They would do anything to push S or work around it to avoid using F. I
don't think I'd consider using F to replace S unless the consequences
were *fully* understood.......

GEC/Plessey specify a series of FM demodulators (SL1454 etc) for use in
satellite TV receivers : 150 or 600MHz in, 10MHz of baseband video out.
I think there's also a related data slicer / clock recovery circuit intended
for use in DMAC decoders, though that isn't used in the most common 
implementation - it may not be in volume production.

The most easily available components probably vary with local satellite
standards, and I think the european systems vary rather widely from those
in the US - so it may be worth investigating locally-available receiver
designs to find out what's in common use.

Does anyone know what causes the ever-growing black border around the

know how long it's taken to get this bad.  I have a 19"" DEC (?)
color monitor, maybe five years old, and the black border is about 1.1
inches on the left and right sides, about 1.75 inches on the bottom and
negligible at the top of the screen.  The only controls are
brightness knob, contrast knob, deGauss switch, and power switch.

Is there anything to be done, or are the monitor's days numbered?

No.  No.  NOOO!!!

The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it
under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in
it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if
you're grounded in some other way at the same time.  

The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for
the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you
plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly 
measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  

They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,
repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things
like sub-panels.)

What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is 
to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,
depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.

There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and
news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and
you should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copy
to you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in
the future.

This is indeed one function, but more sophisticated ones do level control

Simple ones are just that - a transformer. A decent quality audio trans-

The ground-lift switch disconnects the GND line from the mixer. The
transformer ratio depends on the precise application, but around 10:1
turns ratio may be a good place to start.

No, it is independent of the speedometer. The gun processes two doppler
returns--the speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed
of the target, taking the difference between the two. Some guns with
a ""moving mode"" actually have a split beam with one beam aimed
preferentially at the pavement.

Car and Driver had a good article on traffic radar, but it was back in
1985. I used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus
radar-measured ticket. It detailed ""moving mode,"" which is easier to
defend against because of the increased amount of variables.

Gee, I got the idea from somewhere that devices like this were in common
use in WWII, so that commanders on board ships could bellow at the troops
landing on a beach, for example.

Which reminds me of an anecdote from the mid-60s.  At a communications
conference a Marine Corps communications officer said he didn't care
much for all the spread-spectrum multi-access expensive communication
systems that people were talking about at the time; what he wanted
was a kilowatt broadcast transmitter on the ship and a $4.95 Japanese
transistor radio stuck in the ear of every Marine hitting the beach.

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.

The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced,
translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this
does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying
their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But
it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that
the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own
diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.

Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning
that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for
him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone
else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is
not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages
a court would award.

However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,
almost certainly it is ""obvious to one skilled in the art"" and therefore
unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory)
cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.

Caution:  I am not a lawyer.  Consulting a professional would be wise if
significant amounts of money are at stake.

I haven't been following this, so I'm sorry if somebody already mentioned  
this, but you could grab a lemon (I think potatoes work too, but I'm not  
sure), a strip of copper, and a strip of zinc (I think you can get the  
metal in a hardware store or hobby shop, maybe??).  Stick the strips in  
the lemon (so they don't touch!) and you'll get a measurable voltage (not  
a lot, but, hey, it's a lemon :-)  ).  As I recall we had to hook  
something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of  
current, because of the mondo internal resistance, but if you just need a  
demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something! :-)

Not hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but
this hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a low-end controller.
I've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their
8051 derivatives as a printer buffer, with up to 1MB of dynamic ram
that was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging.

Another alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller
chips that ""create static RAM appearance"" and all that, but they may
be too expensive to make it worthwhile.

Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp
out level signals?  Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big
clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact

It is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business 
or for an illegal use.  Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or
police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no
other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor. 

The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed.
The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts
have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction
and sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not have
enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides
avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.

When you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions, 
explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an
association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector.
(I promise I am not making this up!)

I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any 
headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed 
laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund
raiser aspect of tickets.

Imprecise. This description

 1. ignores the role of the ballast,
 2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.

The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts
short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less
heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to
the neon discharge.

The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually,
the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast
because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.

A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent
excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw
sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.

In making batteries you could use copper and zinc in an acid electrolyte.     
Copper=copper wire (pennies are now mostly zinc if I recall correctly)
zinc= zinc strip (Hardware stores arround here (Seattle) sell this to prevent
      moss buildup on the roof. An alternative would be to use a galvanized
      (zinc coated) nail
electrolyte= lemon juice -> Citric acid is the active ingrediant(sp).
 
Volta (late 18th century scientist) used a stack for his batteries-
copper disk, paper disk soaked in acid, zinc disk, copper disk, paper ....
they were advanced technology for the time.

Oddly enough, you don't, at least according to the wiring FAQ that
is regularly posted on misc.consumers.house.

A GFCI senses discrepancies between the live and neutral wire currents,
and cuts them both off if a discrepancy is found.  No ground connection
is needed for it to function.

If the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be
there] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt
supply.  Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  The
regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits
shut down the EHT supply section.

Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower
the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set
operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.

There are myriad other areas for problems, but I've seen the one
above several times.  Also, if the set uses one, the trippler
module may be shot; that's fairly common.

Here in Erie, PA there is a system in the inner city called Rado-Lite (a 
trade name) which allows police and ambulance vehicles to gain right of 
way by controlling traffic lights through RADIO signals.  The receivers 
look much like what you describe, but they include a UHF whip antenna (less
than a foot tall) and a light which flashes on and off to let traffic know that 
an emergency vehicle has taken control and is approaching.  Local folklore 
says this system was invented here; I don't know if this company has any 
other installations.  It has been in operation for at least 30 years, going 
only by my memory.

A method which will directly (almost) provide you with the information that
you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of 
human body landmarks (eg. the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB, Sweden, and the
WATSMART System ??).  These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and
Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a
spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,
the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the
four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of
the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional
to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII
graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)

If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position
of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-
tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When
this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of
""tuning"" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED
for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between
the two is the position of the LED.

Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and
they also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made
systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ... 

Lindholm, L.E., and K.E. Oberg, ""An Optoelectronic Instrument for Remote
On-Line Movement Monitoring"", Biotelemetry, 1, 94-95, 1974.

Woltring, H.J., and E.B. Marsolais, ""Opto-Electronic (SELSPOT) Gait Measure-
ments in Two and Three Dimensional Space - A Preliminary Report"", Bull. Pros-
thetics Research, 46-52, 1980.

Most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate
measurement than you need, but I think that its simplicity beats scanning
a quadrant detector with a pan/tilt system until you reach zero difference.

From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive
device much like the radio in your car.  They work as an antenna picking
up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  Therefore there would
be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of
detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.

Hi all,

I'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd
like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to
use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation
consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.

We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,
and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control
circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.

I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the
cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one
problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be
a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,
so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid
cuetape!)

Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.
(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)
This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.
What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay
for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay
is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit
of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured
out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!


Thanks,

Mark Fontana

Hi,

   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor
voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx 
260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases
and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output
voltage as possible. (about 260v).
  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages
(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v
across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.
  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.
 If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will
increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.
These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of
them, So:

1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel 
with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?
  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase
the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more
stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...
as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new
capacitor will 'smooth' this out.

and
2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to
be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out
the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !

  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH
of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my 
dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not
playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long
run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

Email please.... Can't always read the net.....

Thanks in advance..

I believe that the ""A-D converters"" found on a joystick port are really
timers that tick off how long it takes an R-C circuit (the R being your
paddle) to charge up to something like 1/2 Vcc.  For games this works
pretty well, but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab
measurements off something as non-linear as that.

Hmm... I suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problem
is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (higher
voltages would be more precise).

On the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers
splurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out of
an op amp.  But I wouldn't expect that...

I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much
more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and
some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion,
in a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their
54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple,
repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more
complex events where you need to understand how the scope is
actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope
in ""equivalent time"" or in ""real time"" sampling mode (equivalent time
being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to
the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling
rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but
before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.

Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz
sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front
end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for
equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really
only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single
sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.

So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get
useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for
general use and the digital for events where I need storage for
later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability
of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to
fall...

The STANDARD AT bus (ISA) runs at 8MHz, not 12.5 MHz, but some 
non-stnadard ISA buses do have higher clock rates, but be careful, since 
some boards don't work with faster than standard rates.  For instance, my 
486 has adjustable AT bus speeds, and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do 
AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz.

The fact that non-turbo-mode speed A/D doesn't work is weird.  You may 
have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.  

33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus.  FYI: the AT bus 
operates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus 
interface', which is one function that your 'chipset'.

There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two
years--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials.

When a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the
National MM-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc.,
it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced
for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). Now, if you
have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead
gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know
the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.

The old GE thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on
SCR and triac applications that are not found elsewhere, for
example.

Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a
couple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.
spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C
and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time
delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this
application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger
pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is
disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.
When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x
the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can
be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting
any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it
is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K
resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of
2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)
Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for
256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.
After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14
day timing cycle and so forth.

Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the
electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet
puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to
keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to
work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts
to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see
what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that
has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns
off ;-)

Thanks again everyone...

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or
contribution to:

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. 
The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of
the law is no excuse - they will get you too!

It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. 
Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!"" 
But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,
and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was
there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.

Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which
is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.

For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave
enlightment may be necessary.

So, the questions are -
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?
  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna?
  Are any brands ""quieter"" than others?

sure the heads and the platters are the most expensive parts, with the
assembly costs running a close third.  Cost of the electronics is likely
in the noise.
  Any hard numbers ($$ or percentage)?  Thanks.

 The balls are used to reduce the amplitude of oscillations of the wire during

Just a thought........Maybe it possibly has to do with the fact that it
IS an Emerson.  I've got an Emerson VCR which is #6 in the series.  Returned
it six times for various and never the same problems.  Got tired of taking it 
back and fixed it myself.  The Hi-Fi ""window"" was a bit off.  Something like
the Hi-Fi audio fine-tuning.  When I was a Wal-Mart ""associate"" in '88-'89,
we had AT LEAST one returned as defective EVERY SINGLE DAY.  How's that for
reliability?  Face it--Emerson can make audio stuff (albeit not of premium
quality), but they CAN'T make anything as complex as video equipment with 
reliability IMHO.  Please, no flames.  Just *had* to share my Emerson disaster
in the light of this exploding tv.

  What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the
10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.

  I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially
double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.
The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used
previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham
Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.

  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used
at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design
of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).

  While using this would have let me reduce the ""external"" IF count on
receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I
didn't bother with it.

  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2
MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios
actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and
speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data
stream is another matter entirely.

  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a
""beacon"" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow
due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO
also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even
though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes
of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of
a second.

  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in
and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland
IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the
proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running
low on resources of time, money and energy.

  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW
ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma
Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally
polarized.

  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly
approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and
you might want to carefully consider your ""target"".  If you can't
arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think
you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by
multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.
For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread
spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.
I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.

This is not news.  In fact it's where I got the idea from, since it was
such a neat item.  Mattell made it, I believe, modeled after a ""space 
saber"" or ""light sword"" or something likewise theme-y.  My addition was 
using a motor for continuous display, and polar effects in addition to 
character graphics.  I should have protected it when I had the chance.  
No one to kick but myself...

Ten years ago is about right, since I built mine in '84 or '85.

NASA and related agencies apparently used this same principles to create
the loudest reported reproduced sound. They used an ""analog"" electrically
controlled valve to control the flow of air across a horn throat. If I 
remember correctly it was called a ""modulated air blast transducer"". There
were reports of the thing being able to produce 106 dB @ 80 Hz @ 10 mile
distance, communicate directly with fighter pilots @ 5000 ft, etc.

Recently I posted two oscilliscopes for sale. One has sold, the other is

   o DC offset
   o alternate magnification (10x magnified & non-magnified

   o VERT mode trigger
   o TV sync separation circuit
 List price      $910.00 (...and the price Fry's electronics just

 Sells for       $699.99 (JDR MicroDevices current price)
                 $745.95 (Products International)
 Your price used $425.00 obo
...I haven't gotten an offer at the asking price, so 'obo' applies...

I also have a 'broken' version of the scope which sold:
 JDR 2000 20MHz Dual-Channel Portable Analog Oscilliscope
   o 5mV/div
   o Component Tester (resistors/caps/diodes/coils)
   o TV video sync filter
   o z-axis input (intensity modulation)

'Broken' means: The CRT produces a nice, bright trace, but the trace does
not correspond to the input signal. My guess is it's repairable but more
than a simple calibration problem...but I honestly have not tried to
calibrate the scope or otherwise fix it. It's 'as-is'.
I paid $60 for it in its current state (I bought it thinking I'd repair it,
using the 'good' scope for side-by-side comparison...since I've sold the
'good' scope, the 'bad' one doesn't do me much good) and I'd like to recoup
that amount. As above, I'll accept offers and take the best one.

I'd prefer a local (Bay Area, California) buyer, so (a) I don't have to
ship it and (b) she or he can examine the scope prior to purchase.

	Fortunately, wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than
most at high frequencies; Cray computers (up to the X-MP, at least)
all had wirewrapped backplanes.  Wirewrap gets into trouble at
much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.  The 'increase'
of wiring capacitance is not really relevant (you have to use
transmission line techniques, and the capacitance is no problem).

	Hand-powered is a terrible choice (IMHO) unless you are
a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections
at a time.  Your hands will cramp.  Battery-powered wire-wrap guns
are available in the $150 range, and so are the little
twiddle-stick manual types ($15).  For a modest project, of
a couple hundred connections, I'd prefer to borrow a professional
AC unit... or a pneumatic one.

Aaahh... a problem very near and dear to my heart. In our case, other
monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be
specific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this
problem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc
several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the
juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side
of wall maybe?
We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input
lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference
effect on the computer monitor next to it. 
Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very
common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type
O'scopes).
I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount
around deflection coil of interfering monitor. 
BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH
VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T
BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO
MOUNT CAN.
Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also
good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on
monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other
sources.

Those rules/regulations/laws would be subject to the same attack:  that
they are attempting to preempt federal authority to regulate (or not)

Dear Netters
I want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer. 
Each signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on each
running person. The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred 
meters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is
about 150MHz and about 440MHz.
To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best 
the to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is rather 
specialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter-
units i need.
On the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere. I 
need a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 complete  
receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers 
as needed in the particular case.
DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER 
SYSTEM ON THE MARKET?

What is happening is this:
1) You turn the TV on.
2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the
   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.
3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.
4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.

Things to check:
First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the vertical
output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most
common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
somewhere.
Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),
if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator
then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

Has anybody out there used/tested these new Fluke Scopemeters?
How do they compare to a low-end Tectronix oscilloscope? Are
there any big drawbacks about these handheld scopes when
compared to the benchtop scopes of the same price range
($1000-$2000)?

Any info on the Fluke Scopemeters would be greatly appreciated.

Check out Xicor's new goodie in the April 12th edition of EETimes
X88C64 - an 8k * 8 E2PROM with built in latch AND bootloader setup.
You hook it directly to your '51, power it up, the prom initialises the
serial port on the '51, you load in your code via RXD, this gets blatted
onto the E2PROM, then you reset and run - i'm sure Dallas also does
something like this too, i suppose it would boil down to relative
prices, and the Dallas part freeing up P0 & P2 completely. I wonder
if ANYONE has ever managed to design a single sided PCB with an
8051, 573, EPROM, SRAM and >>NO LINKS<< ?

What's the latest and greatest way to dim incandescent lamps ?

March '93 Circuit Cellar has part one of an article about
dimming 120VAC lamps, but it seems to lead into phase-
control as the best method for controlling brightness.
  I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzing
filaments and non-linear adjustment range. I had
heard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by
cycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp's
power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC, then
nothing for another 20 cycles. I wonder if anyone has
tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using. Any
advice is appreciated!

Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company.
The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were
VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest
problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.

In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets
with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you
can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they
were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory
periodically.

With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be
less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer
recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their
equipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find
that the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, it
should be o.k. for most applications.

        On an A/D board I've got, I'm using the A/D lines.  It measures 
the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with 
5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish 
to lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great 
that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch 
the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor 
only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable. 
 
                What could the problems be and what else could I use
to lower the input voltage?  (btw I've got it grounded correctly)

No need to be sorry, I blew it on this one.  At the main breaker box
where there is a thick wire ground leading to the earth, both neutral
and ground are hooked to this bus.  In any other breaker box (or an

How do you spell ""tuna helper"" ? 

I gather by off-shore assembly you mean that adcoms are built by 
blue-fin tuna's who are into that squid-fi sound?  (I agree on that one). 
My Adcom 555 preamp did sound better after installing the famous  
""running the chips class ""A"" resistor mod"", and replacing the metal 
bottom cover with plexiglass,, too bad the factory could not make em sound 
better,, but better sound, unfortunately, does not appear to be a priority

have improved what was already touted as superlative state-o-d-art le'sound. 
I really want to hear from all those people out there who have traded up  
from an sp9II (even an sp3a!) to a GFP-555/etc., or maybe from those that 
have dumped their forte' amps for a GFA-555/etc....

The Fujitsu 2322 uses what is known as an 'SMD' interface (Storage Module
Device?).  A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their server
models.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the 
Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There
used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in
Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.
Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses
though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but
I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words,
if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.

Corwin

Well, I'm not sure I'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio
filter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine (Ham Radio
oriented).  The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.

This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove
noise (static).  I built it and it really works well.  The source code is
available too.  It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.  Note that
this is for communication applications and is not ""high fidelity"".

You are correct; the fastest ""complete"" image that could be presented on
TV would be one field, which is 1/60 of a second (approximately).  Of course,
the phrase ""TV screen"" is often thrown around in reference to any CRT
display, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates.  Might
even be a vector (""strokewriter"") display, in which case the lower limit
on image time is anyone's guess (and is probably phosphor-persistence limited).

The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,
exploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a
ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser
in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through
the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The
sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for
draft generation.

It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on
both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at 
locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part
time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.
It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.
Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,
usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically
takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed 
to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.

Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station
with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the
incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors
including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time
dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational 
equipment to ""back out"" the errors in its position (since it knows
where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a 
broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local
receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using
the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very
similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the
receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference
unit.

The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series
of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will
use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately
305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals
on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers
correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system
which has stations all across the US.

The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.
Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.

Call a friend long distance, collect.  Ask to speak with yourself.  When
the operator asks for you, you won't be there, so ask the operator to leave
your number.  She'll read it out in the clear.

Do you know what a bi-metallic strip is?
Just in case: it is two strips of different metals bonded together, which 
when heated bend to one side (check out the blinker globe in your 
christmas tree lights).

So when you turn on the power, this causes the bulb to work like a neon, 
heating up and shorting out, thus providing a loop to power the heaters in 
the main tube. When the tube fires, insufficient current runs through the 
starter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out 
(O/C).

BTW, I too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon, so one 
day when the neon in my sisters digital (flip the metal squares type) 
clock broke (flimsy leads), I replaced it with one from a starter. Well 
powering up made a bit of a mess of the clock!

Yes.

I use 74HC4066 and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it 
works fine. In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it 
is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given 
some pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into 
50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more 
resistive.

Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.

Last week I asked for help in getting an old homemade amp working with
my Sun CD-ROM drive. It turns out that the channel I was testing with
was burned out in the amp. The other channel works fine.

So now I need a new amplifier chip. My local Radio Shack no longer
carries components! The chip is a 12 pin SIP (?) labelled with BA5406
and then ""502 515"" below that.

Does anyone have a source? Thanks,

Firstly, I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. Your 2F2 cap
will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in
applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their
performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.
The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,
so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering
the cold).

You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,
that ""rolls over"" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every
1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would
need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the
firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz
oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator
remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.

I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the
solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.

Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't
guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable
conditions.

The simplest one is easy.  Take a lemon or other citrus type fruit, and
stick a pair of metal strips into it for the contacts.  The two strips must
be of disimelar metals like copper and zinc.  Then connect a voltmeter to
the contacts and read the voltage.

For your information:

I hooked up my ImageWriter I to my COM1 serial port and used the C-Itoh

I used the following command in DOS

and set up the port the same way in the Windows Ports setup.

the Null Modem connections are as follows:

This probably only tells you that the DC blocking capacitor that's in series

Open it up and look for the power amp ""ICs"".  They'll be fairly obvious.

Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp
chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the
input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both
chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  

If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an
outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good
enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and
balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of
the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably 
before the other controls).  

If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should
probably forget the whole thing.

I am in the midst of designing a project which requires two motors and an LED
illuminator driven with Pulse-width modulation.  I'm using the 8751, and
I understand that the -FB version has a programmable counter array that can
essentially be set and forgotten to do the PWM.  The problems is, that variant
is difficult to come by.  I need two or three of the D prefix (ceramic window)
version for development, and then lots of the P prefix (plastic OTP) for later
production.  I've tried Avnet, Arrow, and Pioneer.  They (might) have them, but
I'm looking for samples at this point, and they're not too willing to provide
them.  I would buy them, but these vendors have $100.00 minimums.

Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are
1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than
nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many
fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many
fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were
adopted (""why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go."").  
3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally
not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil
plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.

Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants
of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the 
heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in
order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is
normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is
desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because 
moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine 
low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity
causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest
pressure condensing environment is always the best.  

A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where
the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the
condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the 
condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too 
hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into
steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a
particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all
costs.  

The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant
in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower 
they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in
the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 
degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is
used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower
system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water
is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,
operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order 
to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher
hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the
condenser area.

At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the
air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge
water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water
from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and
humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water
temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical
""95-95"" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.
It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful
in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the
plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets
too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive
pressure.

True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and
feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard 
stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.
The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood
the costs of impure water.  By ""impure"", I mean water with a few
dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved
oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will 
find outside the laboratory.

Actually, I think J. Chiu knows the score and is just being
silly. However, ""decibel"" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is
right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.

Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,
and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,
hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).

The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are
all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine
way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.
Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,

There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding
practices here.  A few points need to be clarified:

The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or
the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to
carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the
voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It
should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the
normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in
the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding
conductor.  

Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages
on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding
conductors to provide reliable operation  (""orange"" outlets are often used for
this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in
many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read
both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on
installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated
grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors
back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service
entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many
of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide
a safe ground or a quiet ground or either. 

The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is
referred to in the code as the ""identified"" conductor and is supposed to be
white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in
most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance
panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household
service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which
attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  

The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In
the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the
circuit from the panel to the load device.  

Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding
conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance
from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but
measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,
under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the
grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of
the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since
there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also
no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment
has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the ""U""
ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. 
The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few
tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not
present a shock hazard.  

HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact
with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,
a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to
flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you
will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)
Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in
some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of
inadequate size, causing it to overheat.

With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a
short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may
flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which
increases the possibility for shock or fire.  

Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on
the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often
causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in
technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.

The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as
well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for
lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back
to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded
objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses
quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the
dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it
flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause
corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,
and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop
between the ""hot"" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the
water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. 
(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not
it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)

Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any
sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service
entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have
a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this
application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the
grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding
screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above
ground, with the possible problems listed above.

The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one
building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be
used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate
wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. 
These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days
before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to
have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to
have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place
of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate
neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings
(since most current is in the 220 volt ""hots"" except at some low settings, the
wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. 
So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,
it's primarily for lightning protection.

People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding
conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in ""romex"" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere
there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good
grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes
is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under
the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this
aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does
its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall
tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding
locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  

""Greenfield"" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty
sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have
the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and
inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the
greenfield.

""Wiremold"" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes
often prevents good contact, and the ""feed"" to the wiremold extension is often
from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold
box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and
the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were ""hot"" with
120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator
here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one
of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a
ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in
the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can ""bond"" the wire to the
box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.

On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets
when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them
without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the
protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't
install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is
desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is
connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,
whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something
provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded
GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93
code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be
renumbered though.) 

We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more
to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer
the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary
opening and closing of the path.

The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high
impedance audio circuits a resistive ""T"" is constructed close to characteristic
impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers
the audio.

In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are
shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic
impedance.

Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used
to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.

Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to ""Make before
break and Vica Versa"" but I haven't seen any of these for years.

Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.

A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive ""optical isolator"".. It consists
of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is
off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers
passing the audio.  Once again this device in a ""T"" switches the audio.  Varying
the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and
you have a mixer!

Lots of luck!

Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way. A look in the old
RCA picture tube manual backs this up, as does SAMS Reference Data
handbook. The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT
(not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating) is referred to as a
""dag"" as well as the outer coating.

Thankfully, I didn't need to go to a f****** library to find it, either.

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,
that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs
for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt
radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet 
away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.
If you experience the problem frequently, it may be 
caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station
nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio 
transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,
etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are
correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.

If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite
chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably
being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can
be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).
Good instructions are included with the chokes.
If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your
neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof
or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things
a radio operator can do to reduce interference.

My monitor display has a bad case of the wigglies. I have a good ground. I
live in an old house and I have replaced much of the wiring. I have two
EMI filters on the computer, the monitor plugs into the computer. When
fluorescent lights are on upstairs, the display jiggles, when motors run
in the house, the display jiggles, when incandescent lights are on in the
kitchen the display jiggles.  I could bring a separate line from the
breaker box, and use it only for the computer, would this do it? EMI
doesn't only travel the 110 volt line though. Should I shield the back of
the monitor? Ground a grid or plate?

Hi,
	I am looking for some help in choosing a package
for a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently being 
fabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to test
the chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100
packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed
testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.
 	
	I know for sure that a DIP will not work
(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).
Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so
I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a
leadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard
to test since it has to be soldered on to the test
setup and I would spend loads of time soldering 
as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip
carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may
not work at high speeds.
 
	Does anyone out there have experience/knowledge
of this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/
names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages
would help. 
 
P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit
of overkill(?)

I think there is a huge difference in the materials and 
process for printer/toner PCB's. I get first time, everytime
results from a local HP Postscript, and hardly ever works from
copies of the same artwork. The printer results are so good
that I have quit even looking for PC board processes. If I had
to use the copier version, I would think I would look elsewhere.
The moral? Experiment and find what works. Toner transfer CAN
give excellent results. It, like any process, gives erratic 
results with variable inputs.

Why are you fooling around with analog for this job?  A single chip
micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only
costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed
the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,
use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely
on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want
to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut
you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.

If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of 
maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET
to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than 
you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add
a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count
screams up to 9.

PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This
application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the 
programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.

	Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE
have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice
while wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity
is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately
are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more
battery power.  

	Programmable timers might be less accurate, but they
are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.

The father of a friend of mine is a police officer in West Virginia.  Not  
only is his word as a skilled observer good in court, but his skill as an  
observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some  
cases . . ..  No foolin!  He can guess a car's speed to within 2-3mph just  
by watching it blow by - whether he's standing still or moving too!  (Yes,  
I realize that calibrated guns are more accurate than this, but . . .).   
His ability is not that uncommon among people who watch moving things for a  
living, I have heard . . ..

So what good is a radar detector except to give you a split second warning  
that the guy who just cut you off to pass the guy ahead and to your left  
is about to panic stop from 85 on a crowded freeway???

	Nonsense.  First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of 
major failure of the power plant).  Second, the primary water
(that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the
cooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes 
through the cooling tower).  Third, liquid uranium would burst
into flame on contact with air.

	Cleaning crew working in a mist of uranium?  This is a

I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option

How does this system work?  What frequency is used for
the land-based beacons?

I'm no expert at UPS's, but you said something that made it sound like
you didn't realize something.  On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway),
there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is
ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual 
condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal - 
the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but 
there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it 
takes a while).

If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter,
why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw
things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC
on charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when
you ""need"" it.

Just some ideas.  Can't guarantee what'll work or not, but hope at least
SOME of this helped.

The best info I have seen so far is the article ""Joystick Metrics:
Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port"" by
Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks
about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in
BASIC, and even includes code for a simple ""oscilloscope"" display.

It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to
use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical
Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some
millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has
appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink,
etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.

I bought this chip from Suncoast Technology and tried to build their

If anyone has the pinouts and possibly the voltage specs I'd sure

Paul,

Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip
through them.

Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,
etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.
They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent.

Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge.

My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later.

good luck,

aaron

At 50 miles, a conventional set of TV antennas on a pole (one aimed
at each transmitter location) should work well.

""Rabbit ears"" inside the house are probably not adequate.

Gadgets to plug into your house wiring are even worse.
At VHF, you don't want a _big_ antenna, you want a _resonant_
antenna.

What do you mean by ""police band"" - there is no such thing.

Anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands.
If you applied your test, all of those radar operated door
openers in malls would be illegal.

One of the great problems here is that there are too many
ill-educated (read illiterate) people making too many laws
about subjects on which they are incompetent - there may well
be laws refereing to ""police bands"", they are almost certainly
local in scope (state or county) - created by well-meaning,
but incompetent idiots.

Unfortunaltely, laws do not have to be sensible (or even enforceable).
Lawmakers exist to pass laws - and will continue to do so, until
the day where you are faced with death for not doing X, and
amputation of all your limbs for doing X ... the choice will be yours.

for every other use you can buy a cheapie. I have a metex which is some

bought it about 4 yrs ago for Aus$125.00 (convert that to US and you see 
that it's definetly a cheapie.) So far it has proved to be accurate, taken 
moderate abuse, and has many features on it (CAP, FREQ,Transistor check, 
etc). I am very happy with it and would definetly not buy a fluke just for 
the name. Hope this helps.

My experience is that the CD drawer becomes a bit loose, and the CD either skips
or can't be read.  Try seeing if all the screws that hold down the drawer
assembly are tightened properly.  Other than that, my next guess would be one of
the motors.  Hope this helps.

Hi all,
 I've been following this thread about jacob's ladder for a few weeks and I
happened to come across one of the best project books that I've seen in a 
while.  The book ""Gadgeteer's Goldmine"" by Gordon McComb offers over 55 
excellent low cost projects including: Jacob's Ladder, tesla coils, plasma 
spheres, a Van de Graaff generator, robots, an IR scope, and several laser 
projects.  The instructions come with complete part lists, warnings and 
diagrams.  For those of you who are interested in building any of the above 
listed projects, you should seriously consider getting this book.  The 
paperback version is only $19.95 too.

Now there's a good idea ! All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes, and
a good (wetware) memory (was I using wp or autocad or ...). I thought of the
same idea myself a few days ago. I've got a fairly new car battery that I take
along in my 4x4 when I go camping, and it sits around useless when I'm home.
I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy
duty 5-volt regulator to supply the PC. But I guess you'd need -5v and -12v 
(and +12) too (2 more batteries ?).

An alternative would be to leave a 40 AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery
and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time, and when the power
goes out, voi-la ! the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery ! and
then I could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips !-)

	I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by
buying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile
I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there
seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,
I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some
random 50mV bias.
	The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output
won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed
from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input
impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have
maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have
input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to
use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing
reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my
circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.
With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now
with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of
a pain in  the ass.
	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could
solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator
input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some
low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor
of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd
like to have this box not be active.
	Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I
had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The
function generator was the same way on that one, too.

Yes,

Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about
2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is
at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north
side of the Road.  Parking at the arena is limited.  Lodging is
probably entirely booked-up within a 40 mile radius.  Good luck.

It is possible to park at the mall to the west.  There are shuttle

If possible, get a Montgomery County, OH map from your local AAA

If you don't already have definite plans, now is not a particularly
good time to start to think about going to the hamvention.

There usually is a way, however, often, telephone companies like to
keep all of their internal numbers private. Depends on your exchange.
Any modern electronic switching equipment usually have voice synth
lines that echo the number you called from. The line service guys use this
to make sure they connect up the right pairs of lines.

HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related
subjects. I am currently learning about AM/FM receivers and recieving
circuits. I understand a lot of things ,but a few things I am confused
abuot. The first is the MIXER, to mix the RF and local oscillator
frequencies to make the IF. Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (as
simple as possible) for this kind of mixer? I have come across a
MC-SBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs
(ACTIVE,etc...) 

Along the same note, are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyone
may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?.

P.S. any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AM/FM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED
ELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot.
I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of
circuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.

May I respectfully suggest you NOT do this??  The ground is
supposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggest
looks good on paper, it's dangerous to rely on the same wire for
power and protection.  It'd never meet code, and if you now own
the property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilities
you don't want, and if you _don't_ now own it, well...

There's a ""wiring"" FAQ that I think addresses this.  I believe
an alternative is use of a GFCI, but I'm really not sure what
current code allows in this area.  The GFCI senses alternate
(unwanted) current paths, and doesn't rely on a specific
protective ground wire, at least not beyond the GFCI in the
protected circuit.  GFCI breakers are available (but expensive).

Water. Nuclear stations don't generate electricity directly from the
reactor, they use the reactor to generate heat. The heat is then used to
heat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and the
resultant steam drives the turbines.

The cooling towers are used to cool the steam and recondense it into water
to continue the cycle

Here in switzerland, the situation is exactly the same. The cable tv companies  
even tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cable  
tv(they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequency  
conferences or so). Even today, they use the cheapest possible coax running  
into problems they can't solve anymore. As Bill noted, the only way is to look  
for a solution with the neighbours *BEFORE* calling for the cable tv guys or  
the fcc. The chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by far  
bigger than with these people (especially the first ones). As anywhere in an  
administration people don't like, if You tell them to work for the money they  
get...
The problem is, that radio amateurs don't have the power to put trough their  
rights in all cases. So let's hope they start soon with optical fibers and get  
out of our freqencies.

Hello,

I just canceled my support of the Cable Regime and I would like to at
least pick up the 3 networks and NBC.  :)   I do not have tons of
money nor even a few pounds so what I am looking for is the best solution
for reception for under 100 dollars.  I have seen modules that you plug
into your wall outlet that ""supposedly"" make your entire house an
antenna.  I have to admit, even with my limited knowledge of wavelength
and aerial reception, this seems dubious in its claims for ""excellent
reception"" at best.  I'll try anything, though, if it WORKS.  I am in
a non-mountainous area, approximately 50 miles from the transmitting stations
which are pretty large (Montgomery Alabama pop. 200,000) and Colombus Goergia,
pop. 100,000+.  Any recommendations of products, brand-names, prices and 
company info (catalog ordering numbers, addresses etc.)?  Thank you in
advance.

Hi !!!

Is there somebody using a 56001 DSP from Motorola ???
I am searching for programms concerning audio effects.
I built a 4 channel mixer (4ADC + 1DSP) for audio signals.
I built some digital filters and echos, but now i want to
include some effects like HARMONIC Equalizer or chorus.
The problem is, I dont know how these effects work (so I cant
write a programm).
So if someone has programms or just knows how such effects work,
please contact me in the newsgroup or via e-mail.
(Also if there are books about this problem)

	Also, I've been shopping for a decent, used, [old] scope

I think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over.
I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such
""storys"" about them. OK ?
Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:
   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.
         It has an hightech ""boiler"" but the rest is still verry verry 
         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-
         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.
         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find
         a chapter about the ""CARNOT-process"" which describes how to
         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason
         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an
         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one 
         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water
         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the 
         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to
         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and ""cold""
         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.
         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of
         energy that carnot will give them.
         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !
         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,
         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in
         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent
         radioactive pollution of the environment !
         
   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-
         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still
         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere
         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with
         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the
         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.
         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures
         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. 

   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever
         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the
         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem
         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have
         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and
         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.

You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter!
So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to
a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.

As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most
notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets,
rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup
in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.

GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them
regularly (using the test button).

Running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I
have seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check
their common sense list.  Please exercise caution.

Up to 60 microamperes  =   on hook

My impression -- it's not an area I've played with much -- is that the
much-beloved NE567 is basically obsolete.  If you want to detect a 1kHz
tone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your
input to it, and see if anything comes out the other end.  The NE567 was
what you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do; nowadays
they're easy, and the results are better.

Intel also makes some neat memory and peripheral chips:

Old technology (early 1980's)  
8155  ram plus IO (slow ram as I recall)
8755  eprom plus IO (expensive and slow)


Intel does make Eproms with built in address latches.
I fear that you would need a very flexible and up-to-date eprom
programmer to write to them.

This is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this, but never mind.
Any machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine,  
thermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference  
between input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of  
the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  
of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  
oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  
the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  
steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  
something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  
type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  
unobjectionable). Got it ?

I've found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power
transformer cores and windings (the 60Hz kind). Likewise, if
anybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.

I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power
transformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--something
I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other
words, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be
real difficult at 15 KHz).

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 (""ruggedized"") versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we
got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters
(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus. 
  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a 
lot of them got ""funny"" in the LCD display.  A black stain would
spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the
low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone). 
  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.
   Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....

and HBCR-2010 and they support 3of9  extended 3of9  interleaved 2of5  
and UPC codes. The 2000 and 2010 pieces add codabar and code 128.

These chips support HP's barcode wands and slot readers.

An 1800 + a HEDS-3050 wand run about $150 CDN .

	This is a followup post to something I've written previously.  Several
people responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated 
exactly what I am looking for.
	I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host
via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require
about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots
of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be
interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it 
would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use
an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then 
transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM
needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes
to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).
Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for
this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART
built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a 
company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain 
circuitry I can use?  Thanks in advance for the info.

I got a question from my dad which I really can't answer and I'd appreciate
some net.wisdom.

His question is about some 18-24"" diameter balls which are attached to
electric power lines in his area.  He's seen up to a half dozen between
two poles.  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution.
My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the
inductance of the grid, but why so many between two poles?.

Anyone know what they really are?  Is there a related FAQ for this?
Is there a better group to submit to?

We'd both appreciate some enlightenment.

 So-Called Cool-Hot boxes have been advetised for several years.  I recall
Damark advertising them in a recent catalog.  Problem with the units is they do
a sh***y job of keeping food cold/warm.  The peliter devices used just don't
seem to have enough punch to keep up.  If you want something hot, you need to
heat it up before you put it in the box, and end up hours later with food thats
only moderately warm.  Same goes for cold items.

Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants
are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling
towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for
coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.

Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when
its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network
of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling
and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the
hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than
just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is
rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently
seen rising out of these towers.

That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because
it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of
the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.

The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam
system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the
boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across
the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and
by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it
back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference
(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage ""hot""
turbine to final stage ""cold"" turbine).

Recently, my video monitor went dead, no picture, some low distorted sound.
I didn't hear the tell-tale cracking that indicated HV at work, nor are the
filaments at the far end of the tube glowing orange, just nothing.

On examining the power board, I noticed the largest capacitor with a very
bad bulge at the top.  Naturally, I want to replace it, but I can't find
any sources.

The electrolytic capacitor is 330 mF at 250WV.  It has radial leads, and is
roughly 1 1/2 inches long, 1 1/8"" wide.  The dimensions are important since
the whole board fits in a metal cage, leaving little room.

Living in the Los Angeles area, I've been to numerous stores (Dow Radio,
All Electronics, ITC Elect, Sandy's, Yale Elect) with empty hands.

Can anyone suggest sources for high-voltage capacitors?  Mail order is 
fine, although I'd rather check out a store to compare the can.  I'm going
to try a video electronics store, hopefully they'll have HV caps.

(By the way, the monitor is a ATARI SC1224, Goldstar circuitry, Masushita

RS Components (they exist in Australia and the UK. Don't know about the US) have
little chips called Isolated MAX 250 and 251. They give you isolated RS-232 from
a single 5V supply. External components are 4 caps, 4 optoisolators, a diode,
and an isloting transformer. They go up to 19.2K baud..

I would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in
daylight.  The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward
30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give
information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s),
possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp
current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

Has anyone done something like this?

The rule for the designations is that if it says MC, that means it works
*exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies.  If it says XC, that means
there is at least one known bug.  Often these bugs are small and obscure;
you might never run into them in practice.

Sure, you've already got the right idea.

Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just
run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10
ohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out
1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly
less than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a little
depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or
the availability of parts.

Hows that sound?

					---Joel Kolstad

P.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can be
accurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with
100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well as
keeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.

Assuming 68HC11...
In expanded muxed mode, you *could* do it. Much easier if you get a DRAM
controller IC. The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or you
could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh
address multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd
timing, address multiplexing, and refresh.

Actually, if you wanted to use a 68008 IC, you could look at AN897, which
has a neat controller built in. There is also the 683xx, I think one
of those has the DRAM controller built in. This one is for the 6664
DRAM, however, the 41256 has only one more address line, adding only
another component or so. The 256k SIMMs are basically 8 or 9 41256
DRAM chips (or their equivalent in fewer packages).

It *can* be done, just takes a bit of logic design. I'm actually
about to do it using a 65C02P3 chip... I've got 8 256k simms... that's
2 megabytes on my Apple //e... (used to be in my '386).

You didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue.  Where
exactly are you running 100MHz??  THe digital side?  TTL?
ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment 
all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along
with PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name
a few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as long
as you adhere to sound engineering practices.  

A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design
Handbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered
to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.

The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means
you're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself
has far more inductance per pin than the package you are
testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I
don't see the big concern over the packaging because it
probably isn't going to make that much difference

If you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...
TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.

I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that

fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so 
cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any

am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about 
1000-10,000.

Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part 
number, or when they do look around for something in their line 
they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in 
quantity.

I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole 
calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it 
for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This 
$2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, 
import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor 
chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.

Since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and
concealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low
carrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly.  Hence,
digitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference
than amplitude modulated TV.

    Just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles
on your electronic odometer with an oscillator....

    I wouldn't expect to be able to do this.  Not because the engineers at BMW are
putting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile
environment for electronics, and I would expect the software to be conservative.

   If I were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program,
it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ):

         * Debouncing/deglitching  ( Is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? )
         * Smoothing:  The rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:
                                This is a car, not an electron.
         *  Top speed limit:  Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous: must be
                                        electrical noise or contact bounce

    As for getting in and presetting the pins:  if this is the circuit board out of
a BMW dashboard, I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the
middle of the card.  Good luck getting at the counter :-).

    I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it's
probably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected.  After all,
a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics;  there used to be an
app note in the National Semiconductor Linear Databook that went into this
in good detail.

Here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there:

  I bought an 'Infrared detector module' at Radio Shack for $3.95 - it is a 
little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. Then
I hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared LED. The circuit works
like a minature remote control extender in my car - All remote commands are
relayed to the CD player hidden in the glove compartment. It works fine with
my Denon CD player, but when I tried to build the same circuit for a friend's
VCR, it didn't work.
  The circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with a
Sony CCD camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my CD
player...

	Any advice would be appreciated....
        Brian

A verrrrrry long time, like on the order of days.  I had the pleasure of
doing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my B&D heavy duty at
full speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH.  Now if you go
a high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm, you could get 200 MPH out of
it.  (If you speedo doesn't burn out.)  Anyways, to roll a 100000 Mile
odometer would take 22 days or so.  Much easier just to take the speedo
apart.

Thought I'd share.  BTW, all this info was obtained legally  :-)

I'm not up on the details of US patent law, but I think this is incorrect.
There is a ""reasonable use"" exemption for *copyright*.  There is none for
*patents*.  The exemptions from patent licensing are quite narrow; R&D work
is exempt but personal use is not.  That is, it's okay to experiment with
a patented idea, but not to put it to practical use (e.g. to improve your
stereo), even if it's only your own private practical use.

Of course, it is unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be detected
or that you will ever be sued over it.

This is vague, so I am posting it in case anyone else knows more.

I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification.
Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the
pickup.  The result was noisy and distinctly lo-fi, but much louder
than a conventional phonograph.  It tended to wear the disks out
pretty quickly though.

Is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when
an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing of
the AC cycle?  A capacitor kludged in somehow, etc?

I've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps
in a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched with
zero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays ""quiet"", AC-wise.
But there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay
in the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under control
of my SSRs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resets
one of my peripheral chips.  My software times out and tries again, but
I'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid having
to do some major rewiring/redesign.  A varistor would help but might not
be sufficient.  Ideas?

    as a point of info, some of the early nuclear power plants in this
country used the fission pile as a first stage to get the water hot, and
then had a second stage -fossil fuel- step to get the water (actually
steam) VERY HOT.

   I remember seeing this at Con Edison's Indian Point #1 power plant,
which is about 30 miles north of NYC, and built more or less 1958.

Just to complete that thought, the cooling towers cool water that
circulates through heat exchangers that recondense the turbine
exhaust back into feedwater for the heat exchangers that transfer
energy from the reactor's cooling circuit.

The reactor has a closed loop circuit to prevent radioactive
contamination of the the turbine feedwater.

The cooling tower is a separate circuit to avoide contamination of
the turbine feedwater with atmospheric contamininats, etc.
Purifying boiler feedwater is important business at both fossil
fired and nuclear generation facilities.

Ok, so your a HAM.   Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound 
like some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are 
common IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s)
which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (the
local oscillator). 

Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways to
receiver you.  If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must 
generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local osc
frequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.  
The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Since
the AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...
I think you get the picture.

The pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me:

""A gram of this dye costs a dollar.
It comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar.
And if you want a whole barrel of it, that also costs a dollar.""

I.e., they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering
it to you -- the chemical itself (in that particular case) was a byproduct
that cost almost nothing intrinsically.

We have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders. We
would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between
firings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the same
direction. 

To further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars A,B,C
5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A that
corresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT line
of sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A;
we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the
time the init line of sonar B is activated. 

We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference.
We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply
for sonars B and C. 

Has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and
this type of experience? Your suggestions for remedies will be greatly
appreciated.

I had a GE Emerson 13"" color TV for about 3 years and one fine day,
while we were watching something (I doubt if the program was the cause),
we heard a mild explosion.   Our screen went blank but there was sound,
so we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'.  But soon
the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV.
The brilliant EEs we are, we unplugged the TV and called customer service
only to be thrown around by please hold, I will transfer u to blah blah..
  Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one
(we wanted a bigger one too!).
 After all the story, what I wanted to know is: Is my problem an isolated
incident or a common one? (I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding, but
not here, in the US). Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke?
 I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any
idea where I can get parts for these things? (probably will cost more than TV).

It sounds like your TV is one of the ones that also reacts to the video 
protection.  (Poor you!)

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you 
souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of 
copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to 
the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the 
protection.

One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape 
for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an 
extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR 
first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I 
don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want 
to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.

When the utility gave up on that Cinnci, OH plant (Zimmer?) and
announced they were going to convert it to a coal-fired scheme, the
turbines were already in place, and they were the low-temp type. So the
plan was: Install a SECOND set of high temp turbines, and feed the
low-temp ones with the output of the new ones.

Never saw anything more on this. Did they ever really build it?

I'm not sure about this.  If the ground connections on the outlets are
connected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the
main panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground
rod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of
the goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot
to the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.  

Hmmm.  How are those orange ""isolated ground"" outlets (often used in
computer rooms) wired?

I built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch
audio.  I got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing switched.  I was doing
most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and
nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks.


My question is:

	Is there a good relay/relay circuit that I can use for switching
audio, so that there will be *NO* noise of any kind on the audio lines.


I will appreciate any advice or references to advice.  Also, exact part

I, too, have a XC68882RC50 math coprocessor, which I installed
succesfully in my Mega Midget Racer (clocked at 33 MHz). I have tried
clocking my FPU at 28 to 50 MHz and it all worked just fine. I have a

What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair,
Space Ace, etc). Call Pioneer Technicial Support 213-498-0300 (at least
that's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V1000 Interface

for the commands (play, pause, reject, etc). The guide is mainly for hooking
the player to a computer, but with a little work, you could build a wired
controller.

I guess 100k, connecting pins 1-3 (1x), 1-6 (1y), 9-11 (2x), and 9-13 (2y).

Or: Get an 8-bit DA-Converter (merely a couple of transistors and
Resistors) and an OpAmp to compare its output to the voltage you want to
measure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do
the rest by software (stepwise refinement). The port addresses for your
printer ports are probably: &H378 (LPT1), &H278 (LPT2). This should work
well enough for your purposes.

Hope this helps

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I
ask this again:

1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be
   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?

2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies
   hole currents over normal electron currents?

3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of
   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual
   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,
   don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,
   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,
   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).

NOTES:

   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area
   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole
   particles only exist in the presence of matter.
   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain
   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if
   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point
   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).
   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether
   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for
   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such
   currents *if* they exist.
   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics
   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.

Thanx,
Eric.

I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no
  amp which can touch it at the price range.
The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other 
  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid
  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.
If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components 
  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect
  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each
  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are
  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.

I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east
  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components
  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the
  amplifiers sound so brilliant.
I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with
  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly
  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.

My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like
  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded
  like new.

If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will
  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.

Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.

Definately, I agree wholeheartedly.  If they can build the amp where
  the labour is not so expensive, they can afford to put decent
  components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the
  amplifier - as Adcom has done.

Sure, I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated, the
  amp sounds good.  My Adcom GFP 535II runs fairly warm - not hot to
  the touch - but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely.
I don't like it when an amp runs dead-cold.  It makes one think that
  the amp is doing nothing :)
The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for
  skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below
  and above.  More than enough to carry away excessive heat.

My opinions once again.

AllThe Devil ReincarnateSWR meter for CB radios

TD>From: ssave@ole.cdac.com (The Devil Reincarnate)
TD>Organization: CDAC, WA
TD>What
TD>is a good choice for a CB? 1/4 or 1/8 wave?
TD>  I read the installation instructions on a 1/4 wave antenna,
TD>and they suggested that I use an SWR to tune it at channel 12
TD>and channel 32 for a minimum reading.  Question is, why channel
TD>12 and 32?

The best antenna is one that will let out the most wave (probably not the 
best explanation, but the rest makes sense) A one wave will cancell itself 
out (BTW no such beastie) . The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by 
1/4, then 1/8 etc.

As for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct 
length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the 
wavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR 
in using the middle channel of those you are going to use.
Anyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in, 
nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not 
much point in SWRing. Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it 
anyway.

Greetings!
      
        Situation:  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall.  I don't
                    know the number of the line.  And I don't want
                    to call up the operator to place a trace on it.

        Question:   Is there a certain device out there that I can
                    use to find out the number to the line?
        Thanks for any response.

I have a Fujitsu M2322K which has been removed (I believe) from a digital
X-Ray machine (takes X-Ray pictures without film).  The Fujitsu part number
is B03B-4745-B002A.

I have obtained some data on the device, it is 8-inch winchester-type
of 168 megabyte capacity (though I was told it was over 800 megabytes).
However, there is very little information on the interface standard used.
It appears to use two balanced-line connections, but what each connection
corresponds to I know not. One connection is a 30-way IDC, the other a
60-way IDC.

If anyone has any information on this device, I would be most grateful

I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few 
questions about low level noise.  I have noticed that the waveform 
synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large
common mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another
transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred 
times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to
make my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with 
line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).

How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an
HP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to 
'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the 
input since it will read accurately down to DC.

Also, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, 
how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected 
to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused 
by different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for 
use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I would
appreciate it.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to
have a ""dirty"" amp.

   Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,
   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs

Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for
just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow
down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.

   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt
   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet 
   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.
   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be 
   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station
   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio 
   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,
   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are
   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.

   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite
   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably
   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can
   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).
   Good instructions are included with the chokes.
   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your
   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof
   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things
   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.

And please remember to be friendly when approaching your
local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the 
cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation
and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most
are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes
dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost
pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.
interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  

BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or
not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of
being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.
Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers
to take any precautions.

Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are
required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more
than 10).  So if you hear ""This is WA1QT"" or some other call starting
with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.
CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required
to) and fire/police have other private ids.

They are illegal here in Manitoba as well though I don't know what 
methods are used to detect them.

It has always amazed me with the way the laws work.  It is not illegal to 
sell them here in Manitoba, only to have them within a vehicle.  (Last I 
heard, they don't have to be installed to be illegal.)

Perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I have
a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their
(excellent) gear).

One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is
whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature
is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock
the instrument into real time capture mode.

I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are
_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.
However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)
seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or
more knobs required of a ""real"" scope :-)

This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated
the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy
alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has
a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time
capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in
the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at
least they appear to be logically laid out.

One more thing about the new, ""simpler"", front panels. These instruments
tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement
over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our
scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these
switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the
longevity of the instruments.

I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9V to my
cpu board which runs at 5-6V.  The optoisolator is a 4N35.
On the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor
to the base of a 2N2222.  On the transistor side, I tie my
cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor
of 47k.

It functions OK, but seems VERY slow.  I can detect pulses
that occur at about 2kHz, but not much faster.  Isn't the
rise/fall time of this device, something like 5uS?  I should
be able to detect my target of 40kHz, but I can't get 16kHz.
This is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu
and to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but I'm not
doing anything high-speed.

In the Art of Electronics, it mentions tying the base of the
phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the
speed.  Is that what I need to do?  How do I calculate the
resistor value?

$50 each!!  Don't bother trying to make one yourself, just shop around a

I've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers.
When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4
wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So I
have one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.

Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter across
the red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on my
second line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first
line. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the second
line(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the
red and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts. 

Why is this ? I thought these were separate lines.

Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in
from the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and
went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines read
open.

I'll appreciate any help on this. Is this considered normal ?

I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz
68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously
a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the
systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for
the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works
fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer
of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm)
might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some
suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications
problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?

I'm looking to build a microphone preamp that has very good low-noise characteristics,  large clean gain, and incorportates phantom power (20-48 volts (dc)) for a PZM microphone.  I'm leaning towards a good, low-cost (??) instrumentation amplifier to maintain the balanced input from the microphone, for its good CMRR, internal compensation, and because i can use a minimal # of parts.  

Does anyone out there have any experience, suggestions, advice, etc...that they'd like to pass on, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I was told that this is an environmental based move.  I was also told that

just a suggestion:
take a motorola mc14536B set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten
secs with either a RC or xtal clock input. then feed to a MC14521B as clock
input and decode output for 1,209,600 sec output ,might have to add a few 'and'
gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the'521 to restart
cycle... Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then
goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..
these ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt
gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks.
Then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3"" or 4"" of foam or build a box
of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...
build a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery
and ckts warm.
2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.

Insolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL
rated devices are good to -55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reduction
in capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..

hope this helps

First, it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection.
Secondly, The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire
shouldn't be, or only during a fault condition.

The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the
tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the
grounded center-tap the neutral.  This gives 120v to neutral(ground) from
each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.  So in effect
the neutral and ground should be at the same potential.

It appears as if the problem is related to the 68882/50's need for very fast
(and clean) signal transitions.  I got some email (Vielen Dank, Thomas) stating
that Motorola provides a solution for this problem in their 68030 manual.  
Since my manual (1989) predates the 50 MHz 68030/68882s I couldn't find it.
Could someone please email me the specifics?

NOT ALL PARALLEL PORTS ARE BI-DIRECTIONAL WITHOUT MODIFICATION.

My experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their 
original 286s proves that.  They had the input direction disactiviated by 
tieing them R/W select line of the circuit to Vcc.  To make it bi ( which 
I did ) I had to modify it by scraping off the trace and solder a jump to 
the proper location.  I thought that this was just lazy on the part of 
Zenith ( they were not Zenith-Bull Group at that time).

Do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack??  If not,
then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction
box. If you do get a dial tone, then surely the telco is sending a bill
for the line to *someplace* or *somebody*. Are you sure that what you
are doing is on the level. Sounds to me like you are just trying to get 
at somebody's unlisted number.  Fess up.

I have a spare Fluke 8062A.  This is a true RMS digital meter with

works fine - which is what Fluke's are all about.   BTW - according
to the fellow who designed these meters, they can be converted to 8060A

Of course you could develope this system, but there is already a system called Global
Positioning Satellites.  It gives three dimensional coordinates anywhere on earth. 
Many surveyors use this system with a differential receiver/transmitter to get
coordinates within centimeters.  Basic receivers with resolution of a few meters (on
a good day) are available from many sources.

Brad,
   For an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality.  The only way 
to get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The 
""gain"" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred 
direction) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.

Well, this is my second try at posting on this subject. Here goes...
	In Texas (Corpus Christi at least) if you pick up the phone and dial
	890 the phone company will read the number of the phone you are on 
	back to you. I believe the service department uses this to make
	certain they are repairing the correct lines when they open the BIG

Yes, but in a fairly reproducible way. -40 is only a smidgen of the
distance to absolute zero. And in any case you're going to have to
borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test/calibrate this
darling anyway. Btw, you're probably going to want those big capacitors
you found to fire the solenoid -- High current drain on frozen batteries
can be an ugly thing.

Well, one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on
what you want the ground plane to do.  A continuous conductor is a good 
electrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that need
shielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic
fields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,
like a Faraday cage.

The flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances,
you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.
You aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be a
real problem (one that bit me once).

Here's something I posted about this a few years ago.  It's not fully
up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different
manufacturer's synonyms):

------
In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view
of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my
views on things like availability and backward compatibility):

74	The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively
	obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball
	functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.

74H	Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher
	power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.

74L	Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.
	Very obsolete; use CMOS.

74S	Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in
	power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.

74LS	Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower
	power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of
	devices.

74F	Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high
	speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.

74AS	Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things
	that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.

74ALS	Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly
	new, availability and prices possibly a problem.

74C	Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with
	4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer
	CMOS 74 families.

4000	(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS
	family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low
	power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.
	Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,
	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).
	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The
	clear choice when speed is not important.

74HC	A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power
	consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for
	general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.
	CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of
	supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power
	consumption at faster speeds.

74HCT	74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read
	the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility
	in CMOS involves some compromises.

10K	(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources
	claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for
	serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow
	the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,
	can be expensive.

100K	(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and
	inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.

As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and
74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices
you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just
have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible
with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of
hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.
10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.

Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are
interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.

Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring
and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener
and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever
scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on 
the frontend.

Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm
equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets
dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly
12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that
far down is probably a big no-no.

The easiest implementation to accomplish the above??

This is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you
get the idea.  Choose a high-efficiency LED so you don't need much
current to get it to light up.  Choose values for the other components
as required.

Hmm - I don't think you and I are thinking of the same thing. I was the
original poster, BTW. The accelerator that I'm talking about almost
certainly uses a 68HC000, according to the footnotes in the Supra ad. It
only costs $199 list, so I really doubt if it has a 28 MHz 68030 inside.

It's called the Supra 28, or Supra Turbo 28.
There's an external A500 model, and an internal A2000 model.

BTW, does anyone know if a 28Mhz 68HC010 exists?

We'll let you live, but just this once....

There's more to a real ""storage"" scope than just a long-persistence
phosphor.  Actually, the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all;
what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor,
which becomes charged as the electron beam intially ""writes"" the trace.
With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level ""flood""
electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor
which are next to the ""written"" areas on the storage screen.  There are
some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage
tube, and the stored trace tends to ""bloom"" with time. 

Of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current
digital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a
frame-buffer memory anyways.

A couple of weeks ago, I was asking for a public domain schematic editor
which is compatible with SPICE and runs under X.

I got several e-mails and therefore I wrote this summary:

It seems that there are two public domain tools available.

The first one is called 'chipmunk' and is available at  
hobiecat.caltech.edu or
in europe at ifi.uio.no. In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool 
(schematic editor, layout editor, LVS, DRC...). The schematic editor  
itself is
called LOG.

The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS'. It is also a complete VLSI
package. The fully uncompressed release takes about 130Mb of disk space.  
It
should be available at Berkley.

That's all I got so far.

Sounds like the picture tube lost vacuum.  This would cause the filament
to ignite and could actually turn the tube from a vacuum to a pressure
vessel, followed by an explosion when the neck assembly (mostly likely
cracked to begin with) blows off.  During the whole sequence of events,
the other circuits may continue functioning, which accounts for not
losing sound.

Umm, when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living, I used to get direct boxes (which convert
unbalanced 1/4"" jacks to balanced XLRs) for about $25 each, or a little more for higher
quality. You'll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from 
Radio Sh#$&^t to convert from RCA to 1/4"". Total cost should be around $50. You can also buy
transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself. Total cost there should be under $30.
You can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear.
The benefit? NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component
with the balanced inputs, even when you run them in bad places, like next to power lines.

Ok, I was under the impression that it accepted digital input.

I still don't know for sure if it accepts BOTH interlaced and 
non-interlaced as I have gotten conflicting info.

It is a wonderful meter.  Several colleagues here have some of the
newer Fluke meters, though I still would just as soon hang on to my
8060.  The 8060 a is the 1980s digial ""analog"" to the Simpson 260
analog DMM of the 1950-1960s.  There was/is (?) an 8060B that had
extended frequency response.

I've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by Soar that I keep
in my toolbox at home.  I've had that for six or seven years now
and only replaced the batteries a couple of timees; it is more than
adequate for day-to-day hobby use.  I think Soar OEMs their stuff
for a number of vendors.  Some of JDR Microdevices' stuff looks
rather similar to Soar's.

Since electrical wiring questions do turn up from time to time on
sci.electronics (and the answers aren't always apparent, even to those skilled
in electronics), I am hijacking the following FAQ and posting a copy here. 
I've asked the writers to cross-post to sci.electronics in the future.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers

	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not
	electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If
	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't
	do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,
	or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;
	mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.

	Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National
	Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).
	To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail
	with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections
	simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,
	we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!

	The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the
	force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,
	however, do not.  Check your with your local building
	department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in
	Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,
	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements
	for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that
	we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family
	residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial
	establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different
	rules.

	Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in
	some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary
	of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.
	Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line
	frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number
	of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've
	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or
	``CEC''.

	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often
	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.

Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?

	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the
	National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.
	It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.
	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly
	at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the
	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged
	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.
	And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized
	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the
	recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for
	the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --
	US$65 plus shipping and handling.

Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?

	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up
	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance
	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.
	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two
	or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,
	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book.
	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified
	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA
	standard itself.  In this FAQ, ""CEC"" really means the
	appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is
	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th
	edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th
	edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an
	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.

	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical
	inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In
	Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't
	overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I
	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the
	equivalent NEC publications.

	Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout
	the province.

Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?

	In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.
	In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical
	inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's
	homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do
	wiring in ""commercial"" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)
	are usually considered ""semi-commercial"" or ""commercial"".  However,
	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial
	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can
	find one willing to supervise.

	If you do your own wiring, an important point:

	Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better
	job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,
	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make
	a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills
	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.
	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that
	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,
	and will impress the inspector.

	The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to
	earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your
	time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.
	Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely
	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.

	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.

	Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip
	wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector
	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it
	takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of
	12ga wire through your hand that way.

	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C
	or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types
	become very brittle.

Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?

	First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few
	screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're 
	lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved
	devices) you need Robertson (""square recess"") screwdrivers
	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.

	For drilling a few holes, a 3/4"" or 1"" spade bit and 1/4"" or
	3/8"" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or
	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2"" drill
	(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and
	3/4"" or 1"" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull
	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even
	in 90 year old hardwood timbers.

	Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you
	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws
	work well).
	
	For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or
	ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart ""combo stripper,
	crimper and bottle opener"" types.  You should expect to pay
	$15 to $20 for a good ""plier-type"" pair.  It will have sized
	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should
	be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the
	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There
	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't
	necessary, and pros usually don't use them.

	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends
	in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.

	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.

	You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling
	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire
	loops with a ""loop former hole"" on your wire stripper - more
	accurate.

	If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for
	removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the
	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,
	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a
	""zipper"", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip
	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to
	slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley
	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)
	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility
	that you'll gouge the conductors.

	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well
	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).
	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire
	or the insulation.

	Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired
	outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more
	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple
	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated
	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost
	about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.

	You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are
	dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)
	and work well.  If you get more serious, a ""audible alarm"" type is
	good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known
	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)

	For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.
	Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or
	a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.

	Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent
	wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for
	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap 
	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination
	screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to
	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet
	that has no cover plate).

Subject: What is UL listing?

	The UL stands for ""Underwriters Laboratory"".  It used to be
	an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent
	and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment
	for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means
	that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements
	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily
	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just
	that it probably won't kill you.

	The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are
	permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,
	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will
	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to
	the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in
	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component
	used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.
	Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring
	must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or
	occupancy permits issued.
	
Subject: What is CSA approval?

	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the
	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in
	Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done
	with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to
	the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is
	required by law.

	Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved
	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the
	claim.

	In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC
	(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to
	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance
	companies.

Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?

	USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers

	    Residential Wiring
	    by Jeff Markell,
	    Craftsman Books,
	    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.

	    Practical Electrical Wiring
	    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National
	    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70
	    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan
	    McGraw-Hill Book Co.

	    Wiring Simplified
	    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan
	    Park Publishing Co.
	
	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC
	revision.  Which is currently 1990.

	Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called
	""Electrical Code Simplified"".  There appears to be a version
	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the
	appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,
	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get
	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer
	questions on the net ;-).

	It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is
	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.

Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?

	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and
	inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more
	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not
	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections
	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors
	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose
	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.

	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your
	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a
	permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about
	this.

	If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at
	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage
	claims.

	In general, the process goes like this:
		- you apply to your local inspections office or building
		  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or
		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is
		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not
		  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose
		  special conditions on you, require loading
		  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point
		  they will tell you which inspections you will need.
		- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to
		  have the panel and service connections inspected
		  before your power utility will provide a connection.
		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority
		  rather than the usual inspectors.
		- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before
		  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a
		  ""rough-in"" inspection.
		- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,
		  you will need a ""final inspection"".

Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.
	Do I have to upgrade?

	In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,
	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some
	cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the
	latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you
	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all
	of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.

Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240

	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the
	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of
	a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V
	or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same
	thing...  In North America the utility companies are required
	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.
	This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there
	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not
	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped
	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially
	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number
	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,
	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers.
	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them ""110V"" and
	""220V"", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will
	be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.

	One thing that might make this a little more understandable
	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V
	instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device
	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that
	low.

	208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between
	phases of a 3-phase ""Y"" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any
	hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase ""Y""
	circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.

	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended
	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...

Subject: What does an electrical service look like?

	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the
	main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility
	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.

 	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded
 	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes
 	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where
	the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic
	action conductivity ""breaks"" (often between copper and iron pipe)).
	This is the ""grounding conductor"".  It is there to make sure that
	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire
	normally carries no current.

	One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or
	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.
	It is connected to the ""centre tap"" (CEC; ""center tap"" in the
	NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It
	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often
	inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected
	anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.

	Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in
	a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.
	These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral
	at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional
	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house
	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.

	If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually
	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are
	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one
	neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations 
	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do
	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your
	inspector.

	The other two wires will usually be black, and are the ""hot""
	wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as
	well.

	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each
	other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,
	the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the
	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.

	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.
	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected
	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one
	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some
	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only
	service).

Subject: What is a circuit?

	Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.
	These connections are then used to supply power to selected
	portions of the home.  There are three different combinations:
		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.
		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.
		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,
		   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.

	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and
	lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying
	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they
	often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several
	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is
	usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or
	air conditioners.

	[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar
	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there
	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral
	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing
	the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead
	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.
	When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles
	are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but
	the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,
	and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to
	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is
	permissible.]

	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,
	white for neutral, and bare for grounding.

	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a
	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.

	You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground
	wire.  Since the white is ""hot"" in this case, both the NEC and CEC
	requires that the white wire be ""permanently marked"" at the ends
	to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail
	polish or sometimes electrical tape.

	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the
	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.

	There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)
	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places
	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is ""frame ground"",
	the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an
	alternative to GFCI protection.

Subject: ""grounding"" versus ""grounded"" versus ""neutral"".

	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the
	""grounding"" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green
	or bare wire.  The word ""neutral"" is reserved for the white when
	you have a circuit with more than one ""hot"" wire.  Since the white
	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the
	panel, the proper term is ""grounded conductor"".  However, the
	potential confusion between ""grounded conductor"" and ""grounding
	conductor"" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should
	never use the bare wire as a ""grounded conductor"" or white wire
	as the ""grounding conductor"", even though they are connected
	together in the panel.

	[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground
	separately from the main panel.  Usually.]

	In the trade, and in common usage, the word ""neutral"" is used
	for ""grounded conductor"".  This FAQ uses ""neutral"" simply to
	avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use ""neutral""
	too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light
	switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.

Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?

	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power
	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For
	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should
	""trip"", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As
	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the
	wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the
	equipment itself won't cause a fire.

	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt
	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby
	interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively
	fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have
	large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use
	a ""time-delay"" fuse (one brand is ""fusetron"") which will avoid
	tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a
	spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be
	replaced.

	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They
	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched
	into position against another contact.  When the current flow
	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip
	heats up and bends.  By bending it ""trips"" the latch, and the
	spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave
	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to
	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high
	overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite
	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown
	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which
	damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in
	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the
	purpose.

	Neither fuses nor breakers ""limit"" the current per se.  A dead
	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even
	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which
	can often cause severe damage.

Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?

	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher
	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually
	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts
	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse
	being installed, or the proverbial ""replace the fuse with a
	penny"" trick.

	Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better
	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.

	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When
	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting
	path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,
	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical
	distribution transformer and having your house burn down.
	Breakers don't do this.

	Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit
	fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new
	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special
	inserts to ""key"" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)

	Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse
	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse
	is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the
	labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently
	installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you
	if you need one.

Subject: What size wire should I use?

	For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,
	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,
	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid
	voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than
	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.

	Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for
	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or
	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate
	heat easily:

		Gauge		Amps
		14		15
		12		20
		10		30
		8		40
		6		65
	
	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent
	on the application and precise wire type.

Subject: Where do these numbers come from?

	There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.
	The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When
	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is
	more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need
	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in
	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long
	runs.

	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances.
	There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller
	wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most
	lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits
	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger
	wire.

Subject: What does ""14-2"" mean?

	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors
	in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second
	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but
	remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  ""14-2"" means
	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.

	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes
	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In
	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.

	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.
	Usually carrying 220V with neutral.

Subject: What is a ""wirenut""/""marrette""/""marr connector""?  How are they
	used?

	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used
	to connect wires together.  ""Marrette"" or ""Marr connector""
	are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.

	In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them
	together, then twist the wirenut on.

	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the
	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically
	secure.

	There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check
	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the
	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.

	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or
	your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (""linesman"") pliers,
	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes
	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it
	goes in the wirenut properly.

	Some people wrap the ""open"" end of the wirenut with electrical
	tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may
	tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because
	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead
	of taping it, the connection should be redone.

Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?

	A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures
	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the
	neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the
	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other
	path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of
	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any
	of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking
	the circuit.

	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,
	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral
	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI
	wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot
	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the
	GFCI happy.

	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.
	One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed
	*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be
	protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices
	downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be
	covered by a single GFCI outlet.

Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?

	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase
	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,
	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or
	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water
	or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,
	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',
	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and
	laundry appliances.

	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there
	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or
	basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you
	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to
	outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.

	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may
	want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI
	breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI
	outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in
	Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your
	finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?
	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does
	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?

Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?

	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a
	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run
	unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,
	and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs
	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that
	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary
	current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most
	GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no
	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring
	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.

Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?

	For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the
	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with
	a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI
	breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE
	breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one
	major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch
	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),
	such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a
	multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;
	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on
	what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such
	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.

	One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use
	an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use
	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.

	Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one
	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't
	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first
	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet
	in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But
	protecting the whole circuit is preferred.

	When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little
	""ground fault protected"" stickers that come with it and mark
	the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which
	outlets are ""downstream"", simply by tripping the GFCI with the
	test button and see which outlets are dead.

Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?

	Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,
	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without
	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against
	insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of
	the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an
	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the
	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly
	trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not
	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if
	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of
	course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very
	tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace
	ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).

	There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In
	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with
	exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating
	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will
	happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;
	the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were
	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to
	ground...

Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization

	Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the
	other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)
	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.
	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the
	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to
	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).

	Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.

	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right
	way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the
	narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the
	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.
	If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which
	prong the terminating screw connects to.

Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?

	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance
	circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex
	receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more
	than 24"" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider
	than 12"" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.
	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except
	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits
	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,
	lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be
	protected by a GFCI (NEC only).

	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab
	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to
	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.
	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When
	""carrying through"" to another outlet, the neutral must be
	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral
	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect
	from downstream outlets.

Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?

	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to
	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in
	the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.

Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?

	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.
	Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.
	This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside
	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject
	to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are
	wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several
	different categories of NM cable.

	BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or ""AC"" has a
	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is
	fairly resistant to damage.

	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic
	sheath.
	
	Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable
	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer
	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25"" (CEC & NEC)
	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected
	from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of
	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.

	[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored
	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,
	but this is technically illegal.]

	Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the
	Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague
	references to ""exposed to mechanical damage"" in both the NEC
	and CEC):

	    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage
	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls
	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.
	      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.
	    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces
	      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian
	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet
	      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable
	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to ""jump"" to the appliance.
	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.
	    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating
	      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by
	      means of a 25mm/1"" air space, or suitable insulation
	      material (a wad of fiberglass).
	    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box
	      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.
	      Holes in joists or studs are considered ""supports"".
	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to
	      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,
	      it is permitted where ""proper"" support is impractical]
	    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.
	      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring
	      to the ""workmanship"" clause, but this seems more honoured
	      in the breach...]
	    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or
	      similar finish.
	    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.
	    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists
	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more
	      than 1m (39"").

	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small
	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to
	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through
	the insulation.

	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by
	solid wall coverings.

	In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of
	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a
	UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of
	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the
	wire.

	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.

	In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will
	need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like
	very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of
	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground
	wiring section.]

 	Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be
 	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that
 	purpose.

	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through
	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed
	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this
	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses
	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building.
	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.
	
 	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,
 	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the
 	temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: ""AC90"" versus ""AC"".
	In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.

	NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes
	most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.
	There are very different requirements for mobile homes.
	Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything
	that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?

	The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable
	only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box
	itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic
	boxes don't use metal cable clamps.

	The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable
	armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still
	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also
	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.

	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for
	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground
	connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other
	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For
	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.

Subject: Junction box positioning?

	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.

	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible
	later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction
	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may
	get nasty.

Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?

	In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few
	caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage
	rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half
	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire
	back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle
	constraints as well.  For example, older house
	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess
	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the
	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.
	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high
	temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your
	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case
	replacing any devices is a real adventure.)

	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some
	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and
	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy
	chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box
	specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling
	joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available
	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and
	mounted between the joists.

	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as
	""pot"" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated
	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.
	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated
	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a ""coffin"" (usually
	8'x16""x12"" - made by making a pair of joists 12"" high, and covering
	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*
	long)

	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3""
	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.
	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,
	which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.
	Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't
	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector
	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get
	accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown
	in later.]

	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and
	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are
	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat
	more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should
	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.
	Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location
	for the sensor can vary.

	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved
	for use in insulation.  The ""coffin"" appears the only legal approach.

Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?

	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is
	loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up
	being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with
	respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can
	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in
	some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions
	require the stove frame connected to neutral).

	If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately
	and have them come and check out the problem.

	Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with
	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A
	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness
	far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.

Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?

	Three phase power has three ""hot"" wires, 120 degrees out of
	phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors
	because it is more ""efficient"", provides a bit more starting torque,
	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.

	You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows
	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between
	any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal
	220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the
	two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.

	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually
	ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you
	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to
	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is
	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have
	a ""capacitor start"" unit, or use a larger motor as a
	(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if
	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to
	replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an
	article on how to do this if you must.

	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using
	such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.

Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?

	Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there
	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply
	wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times
	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also
	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor
	will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the
	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.

	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more
	than 50 feet long.

Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?

	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746
	watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,
	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200
	watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,
	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational
	efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.

	Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router
	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far
	in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a ""stall
	horsepower"" or similar.  That means the power is measured when
	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.
	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that
	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker
	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far
	more current than it can continuously.

	When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This
	should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,
	check the amperage rating, which is always present.

Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?

	Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead
	of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety
	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither
	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.

	There are several different approaches to solving this:
	    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the
	       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect
	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle
	       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.
	    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and
	       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can
	       run a conductor to it from the third prong.
	    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.
	    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug
	       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI
	       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI
	       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong
	       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,
	       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it
	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault
	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected
	       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't
	       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath
	       on BX cable.

	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three
	prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.
	Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.

Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?
	Should the test button work?

	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,
	that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's
	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE
	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current
	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.
	This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require
	a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press
	the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:
	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially
	dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.

	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground
	wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The
	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the
	formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never
	tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,
	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device
	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded
	outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are
	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician
	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require
	it, and promised to investigate.)

Subject: How should I wire my shop?

	As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all
	devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies
	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the
	circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for
	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or
	shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have
	big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp
	breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles
	which means you'd have to ""replug"" all your equipment.  Lights
	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared
	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two
	separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a
	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand
	RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.

	Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the
	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.
	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each
	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same
	time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and
	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have
	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit
	wrong.

	Note that some jurisdictions have a ""no horizontal wiring""
	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used
	for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be
	run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.

	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V
	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.
	Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you
	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled
	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of
	the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much
	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)

	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,
	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop
	wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to
	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.
	If you want to install individual switches to ``safe''
	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.
	For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to
	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy
	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.

	Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished
	basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And
	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop
	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might
	have a different idea.

	Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop
	wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.

Subject: Underground Wiring

	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use
	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic
	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots
	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion
	of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is
	generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically
	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,
	fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion
	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And
	of course, don't forget the GFCIs.

	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to
	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about
	your specific situation.

	A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says ""buried power
	line"" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.

Subject: Aluminum wiring

	During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became
	quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,
	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,
	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.
	We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new
	wiring.

	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum
	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.
	Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper
	installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential
	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.

	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as
	""cold creep"".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When
	it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes
	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each
	time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes
	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance
	of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/
	oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,
	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even
	cause a fire.

	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move
	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of
	safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing
	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you
	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring
	for the following things:

	    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to
	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will
	       be stamped with ""Al/Cu"" or ""CO/ALR"".  The latter supersedes
	       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat
	       more expensive than the ordinary ones.

	    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around
	       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be
	       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the
	       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug
	       up each connection.

	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the
	       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.

	    3) ""push-in"" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.
	       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with
	       the proper screw connections immediately.

	    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,
	       melted insulation, or ""baked"" fixtures.  Any such damage should
	       be repaired.
	    
	    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be
	       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the
	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting
	       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be
	       connected together using special crimp devices, with an
	       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter
	       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless
	       you can rent the tool.

	    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring
	       by means of a short copper ""pigtail"".  See (5) above.
	    
	    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped
	       (not nicked) wire etc.
    
	If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring
	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider
	the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,
	we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,
	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having
	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.
	You can do this yourself too.

Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?

	Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire
	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.
	Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an
	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor
	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any
	minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many
	places, we suggest you look elsewhere.

	Here's some hints on what to look for:

	Obvious non-code wiring can include:

		- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls
		- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without
		  proper marking.
		- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of
		  a GFCI)
		- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)
		- Switched neutrals
		- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines

	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one
	time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:

		- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps
		   not properly terminated wiring)
		- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are
		  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when
		  it's *really* convenient ;-)
		- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations
		- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps
		- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them
		- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or
		  ceiling
		- Backwrapped grounding wires

Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring
	
	In the years since Edison ""invented"" electricity, several different
	wiring ""styles"" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you
	may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old 
	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.

	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called
	""knob and tube"" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with
	a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural
	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).
	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections
	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping
	with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,
	the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs
	down the centre of each room, with ""taps"" off to each fixture.
	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some
	cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same
	colour as the hot wires.

	You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.

	Comments on K&T:

		- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about
		  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.
		- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up
		  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in
		  quite good condition.
		- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.
		- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with
		  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,
		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.
		- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between
		  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to
		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on
		  any circuit.
		- Building code does not permit insulation in walls
		  that contain K&T.
		- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be
		  tricky.  Consult your inspector.
		- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more
		  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.
	
	Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't
	necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should
	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and
	be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly
	reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on
	new circuits using modern techniques.
	
	After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type
	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks
	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was
	used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.
	It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback
	is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole
	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at
	a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.

	This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if
	the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as
	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.
	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several
	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink
	tubing.

	After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.
	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.
	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard
	and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be
	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the ""modern"" stuff -
	thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.

Subject: Where do I buy stuff?

	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their
	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or
	DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety
	including the ""odd"" stuff, and have people behind the counter that
	know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable
	sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.

I want to be able to take a bunch of home-made songs (from DAT or other 
suitable master) and output them to a short run (10-20 off) of standard 
music CDs. Would one of the CD recorders designed for writeable CD ROMs work 
for this purpose? Alternatively, is there a service that does this sort of 
thing for a fee? 

I'm after as much information as possible on the alternatives (cost, lead 
time, equipment required, procedure to follow, etc.)  Email replies would be 
appreciated.

Power lines and airplanes don't mix. In areas where lines are strung very
high, or where a lot of crop dusting takes place, or where there is danger
of airplanes flying into the lines, they place these plastic balls on the

    I was wondering if anyone out there in net-land knew of a SIMPLE
way to make a 4-band equalizer (single channel).  I need it to accept
LINE inputs (tape deck, CD player, etc.) and output to the same! So
input impedance should equal output impedance.  Also, since I am driving
a line, I would need 1 volt p-p output.  Final requirement is that I
can either:
	      1. Control it digitally
			OR
	      2. Control it easily, or with few resistors

FINALLY - If anyone knows of any FILTER or EQUALIZER chips, that might
be useful, please let me know. (I have seen a couple of them from NATIONAL,
and MAXIM).  Thanks in advance,

Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me,
your UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and
then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your
equipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to
switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,
as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.

Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you
lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to
replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and
you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.

Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that
AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to
be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.

Similar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back
in the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they
did back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure you
it'll work on today's phone system.  It costs too much to overhaul
everyone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there.

Not even in sub panels!  The only place the neutral should be connected to the
ground is in a SERVICE DISCONNECT!  In your house the ""main"" panel serves as
the service disconnect.  Sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must
maintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not  service
disconnect equipment.

Sometimes.  It depends on your monitor and your timing.  If you don't
have enough vertical front porch and you use XOR composite sync you can
get even/odd tearing at the top of the screen, which is very sensitive
to the HHOLD control.  It looks like what you would expect if you
scanned the even fields (say) onto a sheet of mylar and had pinched the
upper left corner with your fingers and started to tear it off the tube. 
With proper composite sync (equalizing pulses) the interlace is rock
solid.

I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.
a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics
card.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)
and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be
cheap.  

My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each
compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input
went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).

The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my
circuit would not detect it.   

The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work.  

There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require 
split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator
with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply
circuit.  

At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor
circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...

Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing
transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any
ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly
appreciated.  

Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so
I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a
way to take advantage of that fact.

Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,
you will have my undying gratitude.

An Easy way to solve the problem is to use two op-amps to form the
balanced low-Z output, but this solution does not provide any
galvanic isolation between keyboard (or whatever plugged) and
mixer. If no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum, snap,
crackle and pop sounds (formed by ground loops) can be tolerated,
the op-amp solution is just what you are looking for! (It is
cheap...somewhat $10/DI-box).
Not sure, but Craig Anderton did introduce one DI-box project
in Guitar Player mag years ago (transformerless).....

I had the insturment panel go out in my car (a 1990 Lincoln Contenintal) which
is a digital dash. They replaced the whole thing with a 1991 dash (thank god it
was under the warrenty ! :-) Anyway, the odometer was reading the exact milage
from the old panel. It must have a EEPROM of some sort in it that is up-dated.
Seems to me that removing the battery would erase it, but it doesn't. So I
guess they swapped the NVM chip (non-volitile memory) and installed it in the
new dash. No, they wouldn't let me have the old dash to tinker with :-(

I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a
chance to read the news for a couple of days...

The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private
Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around
the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from
the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned
in front of the user's eye.

The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA
compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up
and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the
sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image
projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse
with the background.

I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I
looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking
if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.
The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found
annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly
used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.

I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in
the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.

Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a ""boxer"" type fan by installing
a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of
small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4
uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working
voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is
usually required to experimentally determine the best size
capacitor for a given application.

For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.
It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is
exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who
made the fans for Radio Shack.

I have an Adcom GFA-555 that I got in 1985.  There certainly isn't
anything magic about it.  The components used are decent, but
nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components.

The GFA-555 is a nice piece of equipment.  I'm glad that Adcom had
the guts to not over-do the packaging.  It irks me when I see
audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably
cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they
are supposed to serve.

I don't see any big deal about the geographic region in which
something is assembled.  This is especially true for something as
low-technology as a GFA-555.

I'd hope that a GFA-545 would still work well after several years.
Except under conditions of extreme abuse, there isn't much there to
go wrong.

I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I
came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling
components.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a
current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side
to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I
think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.

Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for
picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a
couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an
efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my
car battery in about half an hour).

Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic
specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the
temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably
its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we
have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no
leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the
two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more
(although that would be a lousy way to control it).

What I would like to know is:

1: Are the above guesses correct?

2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?
   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm
   too fast when I unplug it)

3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like
   magic!

4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?


Thanks in advance,

Unfortunately, you're wrong on both counts.  The most common method of
implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator.  The
local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via
the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great
care.

For a reference on detecting radios, get the paperback book _Spy Catcher_.
The author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local
oscillator emissions back in the *1950s* while he worked for British
Intelligence.

Might be a good idea...  The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV
In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than
that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect
inside a PC.

Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low
distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital
Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized
waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on
the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design.
(That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed
- I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)

If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at
the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete
sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it
uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated
from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design
guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db
max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces

A evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a
call.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000
for application assistance.

This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software.
(Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)

>I would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a Mac or PC-
>based ADC system.

I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out
of your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be
throwing out your money.

I recently bought an apparantly complete Expansion Chassis by Mountain

powersupply brick, interface card and ribbon cable to attach it to the computer
to be expanded.  There was also included a small card with empty sockets on top
and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the ][+ motherboard
somewhere after pulling a chip.  There's an empty socket also on the interface
card and a short 16-pin DIP jumper like the ones used with ][+ language cards.
 
This technological marvel came with no docs and I haven't a clue as how to hook
this thing up.  If anyone has docs and/or users disk of any sort for this I

I need to know:

	There SHOULD be a connection of the GROUND wire to a ground
in the breaker box.  There also should be a connection of the NEUTRAL
wire to a ground in the breaker box.  There should be no other 
place in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in

	The NEUTRAL (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' for
the plug, and is NOT safe to touch, while the GROUND (green)
wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless
some kind of electrical fault has occurred.  It's safe
to touch the protective ground, but not to touch the 
grounding conductor (because there is current in the grounding
conductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same ground
potential as its breaker-box end).

just a slide projector with a very fast shutter.  Low tech, but it does the job.

       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry
that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's
more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  

       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they
usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the
way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,
rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about ""thermal 
pollution"" de-icing a river, said, ""Up here, we view heat as a resource"".  

       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is 
purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when
the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than 
cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.

I had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch,
to put both machines on one line.  You order distinctive
ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here.
You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When
someone calls this number, your phone rings with short
rings instead of long rings.

You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax
on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #.
A device would measure the length of rings.  When it
detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.
Five rings later your fax picks up the call.

This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80
switches now available.

But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new
# to my friends and customers.  This should leave the
old # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the
phone when I hear the long rings.

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits
part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones
(BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might
call MCL; they have a nice catalog.

The universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, RF design
is the _ARRL Handbook_, published by the American Radio Relay
League, the radio amateur organization.  Any technical bookstore
can order you one.  The book is superb, with lots of accessible
theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.

You might also check out _Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur_
(I think), by Hayward and <someone>.  This has sharper design
and test information about subsystems like mixers.

1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope
and adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtual
certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset
control's zero detent position.

2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many
generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest
flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm
terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector
on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out
.4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may
also find that loading the output of the function generator also
reduces the harmonic distortion.

Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to
use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the
voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:

------10K--------+---------? ohm ----

Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T.

-----------------+-------------------

Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy
to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can
virtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the
millivolt test generator you want.

This was the Pathe you are thinking of, although there were other imitators.
It didn't wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs, but
it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air.
There are a lot of them still operating, and they are pretty ingenious.

From what I know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route
the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). Things
like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or
even lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see
the sight of your computer going up in smoke! [Even ethernet cards are
protected. I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is
protected by a gas discharge tube!]

{But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings (i.e. in
controlled environments), it should be reasonably safe not to have

Suggestion: look in the RS data book. They have several RS232
transceivers that have overvoltage protection. Among them include the
LT1080, LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251. The Maxims are suppose to be
electrically isolated ones but still need opto-isolators to work (don't
ask me why. I've never used them before.

Another alternative is an RS232 surge protector. Two are listed in the
RS catalogue. If you need additional info (i.e. stock nos.), just e-mail
me.

Here in the UK, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to 
local lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. Private
lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are 
usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital.

Don't quote me on that..... But I think I remember a BT engineer 
saying something to that effect when I was doing some work
shadowing a few years ago.

Byeeeee !

Like most high-volume manufacturers, Adcom has most of its PC boards
assembled off-shore (in their case, mostly in the far east).  Final
assembly _and testing_ are done in East Brunswick.

The products are, and have always been, designed entirely in the US;
by their own staff and by audiophile gurus like Walter Jung.  Adcom
also tends to prefer American and European components over their
Japanese/Far East equivalents.

Off-shore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products
that perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van
Alstine (and better than Hafler and Forte'), but at a much lower cost.

Of course, if your musical diet consists mostly of Rock, you might
prefer components from Kenwood or Pioneer...

One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG
channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate.
If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be
sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per
channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should
be rather easy to accomplish.

Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without
generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is
in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to
keep balanced.

A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with
a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.
Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws
govern the use of transeivers in your location.

I'm doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need Direct
Input boxes for the keyboards.  These are the little boxes that take a
line level out of the keyboard and transform it into low-Z for the run
to the mixer.  Sadly they cost like $50 (or more) each and I'm going
to need like 5 or 10 of them!  I looked inside one (belonging to
another band) and it looks like just a transformer.  Does anyone have
any plans for building them?  Perhaps in Anderton's ""Electronic
Projects for Musicians"" book (which I am having a hell of a time
tracking down...)?

  I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these
electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage?  What kind of
memory is stable/reliable enough, non-volatile enough and independent enough
(of outside battery power) to last say, 10 years or more, in the life of a
vehicle?  I'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for
this length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that
are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow).

Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with
a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K
actual miles.  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of a
new odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the
buyer it has.

Thanks for any insight.

From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet 
circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving 
a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The
detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar 
detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there 
are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't 
paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the
roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF. 

I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and 
how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector 
in a proper RF shielded enclosure.

We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series. They have
_mega_ address decoding logic on them, various ROM sizes (upto 1Mbit),
various RAM sizes (upto 16 K), and 19 I/O ports which can be chip select
lines, I/O or the buffered address lines.

Cute chip, 44 pin PLCC package.

That's completely inaccurate.  The ohm was an original standard made equal
to a the resistance of a standardized electric stove heating element.  That's

There is a mini-epidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in,
I believe, the Owen's Valley/ Bishop area east of the Sierras.
I don't believe there has been any great insight into the
increased incidence in that area. There is a low-level
of endemic infection in that region. Many people with
evidence of past exposure to the organism did not have
serious disease.

My opinion(for what it's worth) is that 40 x-rays is *way* too many.  
Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays 
that one should have over a given period of time because of all the 
environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation 
is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical 
formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus 
in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors 
in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may 
be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care 
to comment?).

Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, 
I don't think that there are many drugs that can help ""dissolve"" the 
kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium 
have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the 
aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could 
speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that 
a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery 
is being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second 
opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break 
up the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  HMO's are 
notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  
My condolences to your friend.

>Thanks.

You've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which
are used for chemotherapy.

The overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of
these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy
cancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different
effects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than
one drug at a time.

Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle
of a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.

The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis
and RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.
The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized 
aagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.

There are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.
Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.
At any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells
to stop growing.

If what you are seeking is ""practical"" advice, I apologize for rambling
on the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs
are rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to 
experience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small
frequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter
known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines
tthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications 
can be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.

Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always
happen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person 
themself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different
side effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug
headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably
by reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this
too, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.

I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society.
They have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition,
if your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend ""Reach for Recovery"".
It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast 
because of cancer.  They can offer some excellent support and suggestions.

If you have further questions, please send me E-mail.  I hav some good
access to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people.

I wish the best to you and your friend.

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy
of cancer?  I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an
oncologist.

A bone scan is a nuclear scan.  Thperson receivving the scan is gven a
dose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the
distribution of the tracer wwithin the body.  The tracer is usually given
intravenously.  (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will
insert a needle into a vein and inject  medicine into the vein. 

After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the
body, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high 
concentrations of the tracer.  The radiologist or doctor is looking for
areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.

As far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required
to start the IV line.

What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may
have resulted from cancer.  This is also why I was wondering if your mother
has had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the
skeletal system.

I hope I have answered some of your questions.  Feel free to e-mail me if
you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related
to your mother's care.  I'm a newly graduated nurse, and I enjoy sharing
information with other people to help them understand things that they did
not know about before.

My thoughts are with you both.

I hope this is the correct newsgroup for this.

What is the scoop on Methanol and its future as an alternative fuel for
vehicles ?  How does it compare to ethanol ?

There was some news about health risks involved.  Anybody know about
that.  How does the US Clean Air act impact the use of Methanol by the
year 1995 ?

I think its Methyl Tertiary butyl ether which the future industries will
use as a substitute for conventional fuels.

There is company Methanex which produces 12% of the world's supply of
Methanol. Does anybody know about it ?

Please reply by e-mail as I do not read these newsgroups.

I would like to continue to thank everyone who has sent in a donation for the 
Mednews OCR/Scanner Fund.  We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard
Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.

Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:

I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to 
review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  
It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett 
Packard Scanners.  

When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; 
(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) 
automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. 

I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which 
parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.

Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The 
software gives you two ""errors"" at this point.  Blue which are words that were 
converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  
Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted 
correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more 
credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, 
you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal 
dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, 
considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. 

After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word 
processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a 
seperate TIFF or PCX file format.

I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use

an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.  
While most of my faxes were received in ""standard"" mode (200x100 dpi), the 
accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent. 

Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the 
limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just 
too small. 

If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.

                                 Introduction

     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would 
soon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain 
the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in 
the United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has 
been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., 
Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, 
Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences 
of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, 
malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, 
control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug 
resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, 
salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging 
infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those 
in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and 
minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of 
emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more 
effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs 
(3). 
     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, ""Emerging Infectious 
Diseases."" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as 
surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and 
public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation 
of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).

                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     From November 15, 1992, through February 28, 1993, more than 500 
laboratory-confirmed infections with E. coli O157:H7 and four associated 
deaths occurred in four states -- Washington, Idaho, California, and Nevada. 
This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that 
identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from 
one restaurant chain. Washington 
     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of 
Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an 
increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a 
case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or 
postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls 
implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset 
(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January 
18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants 
was initiated. 
     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-
February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the 
state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case 
definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS 
(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with 
confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of 
symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A 
restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients 
who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating 
a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 
through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 
developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years 
(range: 0-74 years). Idaho 
     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-
confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December 
11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were 
hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 
(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California 
     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was 
notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. 
Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with 
E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. 
Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and

four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was 
reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% 
increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January 
1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as 
postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, 
or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with 
onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. 
     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The 
outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen 
persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median 
age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of 
the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community 
controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched 
OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients 
who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-
sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). 
Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada 
     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten 
at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District 
issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea 
contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody 
diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness 
with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with 
onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local 
laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools 
for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After 
SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of 
one patient 38 days after illness onset. 
     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine 
were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: 
0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-
matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during 
the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence 
limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients 
also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-
49.8). Other Investigation Findings 
     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases 
primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November 
19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in ""jumbo"" patties produced on 
November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 
lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed 
to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 
(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. 
     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the 
United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the

contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing 
the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter 
plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one 
slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. 
     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in 
families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first 
identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody 
diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since 
emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common 
cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked 
most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other 
food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been 
implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter 
study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 
that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 
participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a 
higher rate than for any other pathogen. 
     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most 
clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses 
associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea 
(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups 
and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and 
complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients 
develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. 
     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community 
outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite 
the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in 
three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington 
(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from 
persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). 
When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported 
to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public 
health action to prevent further cases. 
     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can 
contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify 
critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce 
the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. 
Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with 
pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens 
from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be 
internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook 
ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices 
are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played 
an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim 
recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 
155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). 
     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report 
and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be 
consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of 
outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of 
this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections 
caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. 
coli O157:H7.

            Use of Smokeless Tobacco Among Adults -- United States,
                                     1991
            =======================================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     Consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the 
United States almost tripled from 1972 through 1991 (1). Long-term use of 
smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of 
oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who 
currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). 
To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, 
CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease 
Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing 
tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, 
noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This 
report summarizes findings from this survey. 
     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked ""Have you used snuff at least 20 
times in your entire life?"" and ""Do you use snuff now?"" Similar questions were 
asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of 
smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco 
use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the 
time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having 
used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the 
time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and 
former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at 
least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as 
those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not 
smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on 
smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or 
equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide 
national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using 
standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) 
(3). 
     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users 
of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) 
women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco 
use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was 
highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was 
highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan 
Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American 
Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was 
substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in 
rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among

men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only 
for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). 
     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those 
aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of 
chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although 
women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest 
among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. 
     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being 
former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were 
former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons 
aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users 
(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% 
CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users 
was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% 
95% CI=68.9-78.1). 
     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) 
currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% 
CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% 
CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. 
     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% 
95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-
49.6).

Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National

Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless 
tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in 
particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that 
link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral 
snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this 
behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for 
nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). 
     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among 
racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels 
and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require 
further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role 
in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the 
differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). 
     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current 
smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the 
prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco 
users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous 
study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked

occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked 
reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to 
stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health 
implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. 
     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special 
population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless 
tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year 
2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more 
than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the 
prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless 
tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, 
enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes 
commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to 
routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based 
prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit 
tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

Yeah, the ""Feingold Diet"" is a load of crap.  Children diagnosed with ADD
who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  Of course, the parents
who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their
children's development.  So much for the value of ""interesting anecdotal
results"".  People will believe anything if they want to.

Compartment syndrome occurs when swelling happens in a ""compartment""
bounded by fascia.  The pressure rises in the compartment and blood
supply and nerves are compromised.  The treatment is to open the
compartment surgically.  THe most common places for compartment
syndromes are the forearm and calf.  It is an emergency, since
if the pressure is not relieved, stuff will die.

The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital
but I can answer a few general points.

Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after
being in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment
will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even
young people find the change unsettling.

Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -
anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the
elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the
change of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have
tried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the
patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of
the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these
patients early.

Anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)
generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to
the individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full
mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is
the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult
tasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.

Haloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life
of the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow
release formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are
sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. Without knowing
more it is hard to comment.

Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as
well as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. B12
deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy, B12 deficiency in
hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia), yet I sill
hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine:  candida can cause
mucocutaneous candidiasis, and, in already very sick patients
with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients,
systemic candida infection.  I think ""The Yeast Connection"" is
a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well
nutrition is taught, anyway?

Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast
was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the
mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, 
depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as
reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues
but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe
call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?  Maybe we
should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.

Tenderizing beef involves sprinking or marinading it in papain, an enzyme.
""Meat tenderizer"" packets might contain papain and MSG and seasonings, but
MSG doesn't act as a tenderizer.

 Marty, I personally wouldn't be so quick and take that NEJM article 
 on kidney stones as gospel. First of all, I would want to know who
 sponsored that study.
 I have seen too many ""nutrition"" bulletins over the years from
 local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the
 bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us
 compliments of the Dairy Industries.
 There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive
 financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous 
 benefits of increasing one's calcium intake.

 Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved 
 in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study
 didn't say that, it only claimed that ""most kidney stones are large-
 ly calcium.""
 Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact
 opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they
 are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.
 
 Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still 
 the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention 
 of kidney stones.
 I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in
 one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney
 stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE
 in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium
 type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit
 from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

Listen: thrush is a recognized clinical syndrome with definite
characteristics.  If you have thrush, you have thrush, because you can
see the lesions and do a culture and when you treat it, it generally
responds well, if you're not otherwise immunocompromised.  Noring's
anal-retentive idee fixe on having a fungal infection in his sinuses
is not even in the same category here, nor are these walking neurasthenics
who are convinced they have ""candida"" from reading a quack book.

	Ask the practitioner whether he uses the pre-sterilized disposable
needles, or if he reuses needles, sterilizing them between use.  In the
former case there's no conceivable way to get AIDS from the needles.  In
the latter case it's highly unlikely (though many practitioners use the
disposable variety anyway).

We know that sermon.  It is posted roughly every month or so by different
persons, and that doesn't make it any better.

How did you get the idea that skeptics are closed-minded?  Why don't you
consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the
proper methods?  Besides, one can come to a conclusion without closing
one's mind to other possibilities.

I you don't agree with a person, please ask him why he thinks like that,
instead of insulting him.  Perhaps he's right.  Follow your own advice,
be open-minded.

If you don't post a bit of evidence for your claims, I'll complain that
it's always those ""neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever"" types who 
narrow-mindedly judge others without knowing their motives.

Ok, much as I hate to do it, here I am posting an EVEN BETTER ""Dr. Idiot""
story.


I was in my 18th hour of labor, had been pushing for 4.5 hours and was
exhausted.  My OB and I decided to go for a csec.  The OB called in
the anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery.

AFTER, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus as
I like to refer to him) said, ""Well, I am off duty now."" (still staring
between my legs at that).  The OB asked to go call whomever it was who
was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was going
to take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty.

The anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes.   In a couple of
minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes. had left
without even trying to get ahold of the on-call.  It was the only time 
during my labor that I swore.  The on-call anes. took 20 minutes to get
there.

Come to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutes
before) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the
next on-call got there.  Good thing for all of us (especially him) that
it was not a critical emergency.  But boy would I love to knock that
fellow's ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain a
few little minutes.



I have run into ""Dr. Idiots"", ""Mechanic Idiots"", ""Clerk Idiots"" and ""Etc.

Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.

No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is
that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of
Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and
secondary neuronal ischemia).

Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not
seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The
Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF
studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura,
but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.

From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in
the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From
another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of
the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache,
therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.

Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling
headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic
colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients
they can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill
my office with patients holding their heads in pain.

Not to drag this out anymore, but....

Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that
in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs
presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.

A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs
can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been
an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements
for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease.
Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to ""prove"" that
the disease exists.

This paper is noteworthy in two other regards:

1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs
had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5
months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further
clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So
these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous
recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations
longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't
have the same chronicity that some see in humans.

2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the
vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want
the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine
efficacy.

Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations
of this vaccine in the next year or so.

the same as Austria (I have direct experience in the Swiss case).

I found that in combination with Acupuncture it changed my life from
living hell to a condition which enables me to lead a relatively 
normal life. I found that modern medicine was powerless to cure me
of a *severe* case of Neurodermitis (Note: I mean cure, not 
surpress the symptoms, which is what modern medicine attempts to 
do in the case of Neurodermitis).

My girlfriend used to work in a lab studying different natural carcinogens.

Basically, she said that if you eat barbecued foods with strawberries
(a natural carcinogen) the slight carcinogenic properties of both
cancel out each other.

Yes, absolutely, though I'd make the observation in a more general sense of
all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various

But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again,

Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic

think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the 
business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic 
assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific
research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis
and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than 
""the old Newtonian model of the world"".  And I doubt that many psychologists
would appreciate being put outside this empirical ""world view"".  Psychology
also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. 

>It is also important to distinguish reason from science. Science may be

Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-
tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually 
found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will 
have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  
There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of
knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own 
discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,
even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come
to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had 
a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and 
tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting
science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a 
creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally
turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  

Again, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by ""science"".  I often
don't recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way science
is portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They
portray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTH
in big gold letters.  That's silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab,
turn over a stone, and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula-
tion.  Its much more interesting than that.  It really is a very human
process.

I guess I'm still not clear on what the term ""candida bloom"" means,
but certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal
infections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use.
This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome, the ""quack""
diagnosis that has been being discussed.

Lucky how?  Since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of
oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis, I've mentioned to a 
number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily.  It turns out most would
rather just use anti-fungal creams when they get yeast infections.

>yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as

Again, this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about, and
has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed.
There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with
bacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in
reducing diarrhea, but I don't think anyone would view this as a
quack therapy.

This will be the first of monthly postings of the newsletter of 
the Long Island Chapter of the Transplant Recipients 
International Organization (TRIO).  Unfortunately, I was unable 
to post it before the date of this month's meeting.  I'm 
posting it anyway, and posting it world-wide instead of 
regional, in the hopes that some of the information may be 
useful or illustrative.  Also, I hope it can be used as an 
example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters 
and data related to organ transplantation and donation.

                                         VOLUME IV   No. 8


NEXT MEETING


The next meeting is WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 at 8 pm at the Knights 
of Columbus Emerald Manor, 517 Uniondale Avenue in Uniondale.  
Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman 
trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant 
Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University 
Medical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in 
transplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is 
a long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and 
always a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a 
very informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our 
hospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence 
will be well prepared, and at last the weather should be 
cooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome 
Dr. Teperman. 

          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE


LAST MEETING

It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of 
TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being 
able to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  
No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored 
again, but we were also able to disable the Long Island 
Railroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many 
braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good 
conversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, 
a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not 
able to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to 
discuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, 
an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient 
was kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman 
gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, 
(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to 
minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine 
and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank 
her for an entertaining evening.



ANNUAL MEETING

In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is 
also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official 
notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main 
purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit 
member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and 
to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two 
year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following 
slate for the Board.

         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen
         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith
         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia
         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)
         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)
         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)
         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)

Those remaining on the Board for another year are:

         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)
         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn
         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy
         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)
         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)
         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)

This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work 
and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have 
backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition 
to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also 
be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board 
members and there is plenty of work. 

In addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be 
given and the floor will be open for any new business, 
suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.

We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the 
majority of the time with Dr. Teperman.

FUTURE MEETINGS

Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  

     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry
                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center

     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony 
                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. 

Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.

NOTDAW

The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor 
Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, 
speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and 
Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   
because of two year's experience with miserable weather. 

We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We 
have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish 
a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to 
address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of 
life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample 
letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.

DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED 

The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will 
hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the 
Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas 
Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and 
are going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne 
Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.

Who knows in this legal climate, but there is tremendous legal precendent
for forcibly quarantining TB patients in sanitariums.  100 yrs ago
it was done all the time.  It has been done sporadically all along
in patients who won't take their medicine.  If you have TB you

and you may find they have the legal power to insist you make your

I have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having
 osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his
 illness is the rare Gaucher's disease. 

Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 
 inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal
 bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is
 attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the
 enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.
 This will eventually cause death.

Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and
 approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients
 administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable
 improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured
 by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000
 per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called ""the most
 expensive disease in the world"".

NEED INFO:
I have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying
 on netlanders to provide me with any additional information:
**news, stories, reports
**people you know with this disease
**ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold of
   enough money to buy some, programs available to help with
   costs.
**Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER

Thanks so very much!

Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible.
Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will
then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic
engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.
No breeding, no ""hybrids"", etc.  The ethical question is, should
we do this?  Should we make a race of disease-free, long-lived,
Arnold Schwartzenegger-muscled, supermen?  Even if we can.

   Many of these cereals are corn-based. After your post I looked in the

A couple of folks have suggested the ""corn connection"".  In the five month
period between the two seizures, my daughter had eaten a fair amount of
Kix and Berry Berry Kix in the mornings and never had a problem.  I checked
the labels and the first ingredient is corn.  She has also never had a problem
eating corn or corn on the cob but of course, that is usually later in the day
with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high.  I do believe that
Frost Flakes have corn in them but I will have to check the Fruit Loops.  But
the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me
wonder.

Thanks for checking into this.  All information at this point is valuable to me.

Hi...

I need information on scaring. Particularly as a result of grazing the skin
I really wanted to know of 

	1. would a scar occur as a result of grazing
	2. if yes, then would it disappear?
	3. how long does a graze take to heal?
	4. will hair grow on it once it has healed?
	5. what is 'scar tissue'?
	6. should antiseptic cream be applied to it regularly?
	7. is it better to keep it exposed and let fresh air at it?

Please help - any info - no matter how small will be appreciated greatly.

Second, for not making my argument clear enough. I reacted to the tone

They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).
Oops, that is not a recognized ""illness"" in the psychological community,
better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)

Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians
will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,
just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general
population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among
physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -
any help here a.p.p.er's?)

One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious
choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to
control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are
also extroverted, they are best described as ""Field Marshalls"".  This trait
is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to
lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,
to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and
technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-
minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types
and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,
when the NT person has self-image challenges, the ""dark-side"" of this
personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.

A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their
temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),
and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient
must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've
known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them
with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they
usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an
extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).

Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)

Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.

You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have
been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being
the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people
myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion
above the level of anal effluent.

In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune
stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses
were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.
I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks
of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial
infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the
details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this
diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the
difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed
a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you
understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal
therapy below).


The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor
mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being
considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween
infection.

I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after
my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then
dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received
zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly
complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular
specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,
he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)
supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.
Call me carrot face.  :^)

Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to
all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for
example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had
good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order
improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is
not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.

Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that
I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my
sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that
demonstrate candida ""blooms"" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation
(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one
week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this
time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on
Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered
normal).

BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't
remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's
which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)
aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus
inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it
is relevant to this discussion.


>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus 
>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to 
>the candida or not isn't certain.

My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic
response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.
Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test
is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow
part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a 
threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to
Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane
irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,
one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a 
Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.

BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, ""Sinus Survival"",
has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic
anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic
sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in
the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over
90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it
doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection
is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that
nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.

This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is
aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway
into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by
direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,
lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who
has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start
with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.


>If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty 
>nondescript.  

This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny
and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the
appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture
the yeast ""bloom"" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or
even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually
impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot
be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.

It's a real Catch-22.

Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that
no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not
up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which
should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should
be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to
convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,
you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to
compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study
needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get
funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the
smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other
doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes
into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get
nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.

It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have
*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to
noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable
hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence
to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would
also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - 
excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will
not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold
such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...

Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus
species can grow hyphae (""roots"") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing
in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but
you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic
anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such
as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has
been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in
e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-
term treatment of GI tract ""candidiasis"".  It's like trying to weed a garden
by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come
out again once you walk away.

The $60000 question is whether a contained candida ""bloom"" can partially
grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms
in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming ""systemic"" in the
classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive
bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that
is potentially lethal.

As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system
that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt
alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.
For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live
with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention
surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not
get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and
fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and
equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly
improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.
Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have
improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the
experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to ""live with
it"".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total ""cure"".  The
anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction
because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those
having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.
Be sure to get the revised edition.)


>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic 
>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
>patients is a non-existent syndrome.

Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his
visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said ""you'll just have
to live with it"".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and
non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now
shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road
to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a
systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of
anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own
practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-
""yeast hypothesis"" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,
""it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases"", to put it mildly.
I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating
their moral obligations to help the patient.

Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are
confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the ""hypothetical
yeast overgrowth"" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people
have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues
have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -
you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does
something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a
thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?
Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works
instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become
so enamored with ""scientific correctness"" that they are ignoring the patients
they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which
we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when
you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach
(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having
exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional
medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I
went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,
and as a result I have found significant relief.

Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up
some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having
his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)
therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the
accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:
""well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this
country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority
to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I
can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign
something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of
these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State
Board.""  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this
pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic
reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much
risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the
patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,
and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would
be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the
compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything
it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism
that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of
which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all
(true quackery).

I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.

Brave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one
develops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have
backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune
system, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual
desensitization.  I now kind of like being called ""anal retentive"" - it has
a nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the
post - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might
even cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  Hmmm...

I agree. Adding layers of managers and bureaucrats simply eat up
money that could be spent on those who actually are doing the work
such as doctors and nurse, and supplies.  The most efficient system
is probably one that has limited management and a fixed budget such
as England's or even Canada's.  I'm afraid we are on the wrong
track.  The problem may be that the insurance lobby is too powerful.

  Another folk remedy receives the blessing of medical study.           
Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically    
reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.
  For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical    
Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from 
chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate
8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second 
6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    
women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection 
were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   
  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  
It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   
researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    
brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         
thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  
in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         
protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to  
try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     
acidophilus in its contents.

  Candida (Monilia)                                                     
  This disease is usually caused by Candida albicans, a fungus that we  
all carry at one time or another. In some circumstances, though, the    
organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,    
intestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the 
disease is commonly called thrush.                                      
  Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control     
pills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.   
Among narcotic addicts, Candida infections can lead to heart valve      
inflammation.                                                           
  Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood    
tests. Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole.
There is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals
leads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in     
their intestines. Claims for any benefit from special diets or chronic  
antifungal agents is not based on any solid evidence.

I think it's safe to say that anything that's not at 0 degrees Kelvin
will have its own ""energy signature"" -- the interesting questions are
what kind of energy, and what it signifies.

I'd check places like Edmund Scientific (are they still in business?) --
or I wonder if you can find ex-Soviet Union equipment for sale somewhere
in the relcom.* hierarchy.

Some expansion on Kirlian photography:

From the credulous side: [Stanway, Andrew, _Alternative Medicine: A Guide
To Natural Therapies_, ISBN 0-14-008561-0, New York: Viking Penguin, 1986,
p211, p188.  A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32
alternative health therapies.]

  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the
  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'
  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object
  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its
  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner
  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found
  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead
  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones
  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in
  highly variable colour patterns.

  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in
  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up
  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at
  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and
  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.

  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's
  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on
  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers
  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and
  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose
  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that
  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person
  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to
  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.

  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is
  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from
  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the
  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely
  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'
  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing
  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern
  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would
  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid
  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than
  the actual object itself.

  [...]

  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer
  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...


From the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, ""Reality shopping; a
consumer's guide to new age hokum."", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,
vNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for
evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examples
of hokum.]

  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of
  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal
  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for
  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will
  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and
  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that
  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian
  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.
  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings
  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The
  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on
  the surface of the body and not to mysterious ""auras"" or even
  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,
  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous
  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of
  the unknown.

The proper spelling is Kirlian. It was an effect discoverd by
S. Kirlian, a soviet film developer in 1939.

As I recall, the coronas visible are ascribed to static discharges
and chemical reactions between the organic material and the silver

Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic
depression, or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get
depressed, but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the
thyroid that would cause depression. Note that weight gain is usually
a symptom of both. Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid
condition is present.

I don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output,
but I would tend to doubt it. As far as I know clinical depression is
caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical
imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. A regular
everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the
body at all.

The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH)
on the level of circulating Thyroxin (there are two types T3 and T4 -
one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in
the liver). The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other
hormones (estrogen, for example). Naturally, changing activity of the
body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but
the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in
short order.

Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual (a physician's
reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-)
and the Encyclopedia Brittanica (should be available in your local
library).

I hope this has been of some help.

Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the
rinds of citrus fruits.  These have been popular, especially in Europe,
to treat ""capillary fragility"", and seemingly in even more extreme cases--
a few months ago, a friend was visiting from Italy, and he said that he'd
had hemorrhoids, but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills.  Incredulously,
I asked to look at them, and sure enough these contained rutin as the active
ingredient.  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical
sputtering.  I have no idea how he's doing hemorrhoid-wise these days.
The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in
human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled, so the
reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal.

This stuff is pretty much non-toxic, and probably inexpensive, so there's
little risk of trying it, but I wouldn't expect much of a result.

Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg.  There is only one way for
pregnancy to occur: intercourse.  These days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques, but we're speaking of

     The questions raised by Moore et al. about recombinant gp160  envelope 
glycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by  MicroGeneSys are advantages 
rather than disadvantages, write  Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of 
MicroGeneSys in Meriden,  Conn.  Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus 
expression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this  
recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus 
does in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in 
patients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune 
responses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and 
CD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never 
intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.  Antibody 
responses against native HIV-1 proteins,  including the types described by 
Moore et al., exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not prevent

progression of HIV disease.  In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120-
antibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific 
activation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which  
may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4 
binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added 
safety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts, 
stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune 
function.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 was 
chosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first 
phase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith.

""HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission"" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 
341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline) 

     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive 
women breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The 
anti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of 
leukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic  
activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to 
barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to 
twelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.  
Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory 
illnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive 
mothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV-
1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than 
bottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower 
progression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer 
protection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of 
milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA 
antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against 
core antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a 
human  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and 
malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is 
still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status.  
Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early 
milk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast 
milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and  
may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok.

et al. of the University of Miami  School of Medicine in Miami, Fla.  The 
researchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and 
attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patients 
with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysis 
was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the 
dentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the 
medical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug 
abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.  
There were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124  
were deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patients 
identified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were either 
homosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the 
remaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection was 
reported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidence 
of risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single  
evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequence 
analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients 
were not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIV 
transmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting 
in which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  et 
al.

     Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once, which makes the 
resurging health hazard harder to control, according to a  study published in 
today's New England Journal of Medicine.   People who contract TB usually 
develop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria 
again.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight 
off a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  Hughes 
Medical Institute at Stanford University, director of the  study, said that in 
order to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people to 
use TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB 
bacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County 
Hospital  in New York.

     Because there is no proof that HIV is the cause of AIDS, the  hypothesis 
that drug use leads to AIDS will hopefully become a  hindrance to the 
physiologically (AZT) and psychologically  (positive AIDS test) toxic public 
health initiatives, writes  Peter Duesberg of the University of California--
Berkeley.  In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's  
hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to 
AIDS, ""a hindrance to public health initiatives.""   However, their hypothesis 
that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.  
The U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, 
no prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this 
hypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  
depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies 
against HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals 
from Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug-
AIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-
free AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  
use altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to 
produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years 
HIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same 
AIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by

Alternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugs

individuals through the amplification of harmful  ""autoimmune"" reactions, 
write Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.  
The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with 
hepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,  
profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the 
observation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had 
circulating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the 
end of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 
contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  
aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens, 
homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.  
These autoantibodies, which also  recognize ""native"" class II molecules and 
may contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells ""in vivo"", were at low tires 
(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such  
autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and 
HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss 
in some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful 
""autoimmune"" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA 
antigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell 
counts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very  
rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with 
these HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude.

""TB Makes a Comeback"" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6   
(Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.) 

     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United 
States, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants, 
minorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at the 
University of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung 
Association,  said, ""Right now, it's a big city problem, but potentially it's  
everyone's problem.""  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected 
with TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their 
immune systems are depressed,  especially those with AIDS or HIV.  Gene

Tammes, a Centers for  Disease Control expert, said that is why the CDC has 
issued  guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS  with TB 
patients.  State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because 
those who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with 
treatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public 
health services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic ""because the number of 
cases  is increasing faster than we can treat people,"" said Dr. George  
Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to 
Diferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of 
diagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City 
residents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their  
medication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more 
expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to 
treat.

 ""Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern 
Florida: Artifact or Reality?"" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. 
83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) 

     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in 
southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write 
Okey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.  
The researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal 
Palm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual 
transmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, 
or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route 
of HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records 
from social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually 
transmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor 
was found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  
standardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were 
reviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission 
categories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the 
percentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties 
between January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to 
heterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men 
and from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of  
heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after 
adjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the 
national average, the researchers  conclude.

	Greg, no flame intended, but you have no discernible sense of
humor.  What Bill wrote was intended to be funny.  It's called a

	Besides, Kirilian photography is actually photography of my

If you can get it, you might want to try a Canadian over-the-counter product
called Secaris, which is a water-soluble gel.  Compared to Vaseline or other
greasy ointments, Secaris seems more compatible with the moisture that's

	   In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my
   knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic
   object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns
   or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type
   of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might
   extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
   the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.

There have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals)
published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I can't be
more specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describe
what is needed and how to set up the apparatus.  

These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can
be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the
moisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the
""energy signature"" of organic objects.

I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school.
I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by
first dunking them in water.

The picture from the press conference on the cover of the Times
that day had Prof. Altman at the lectern holding a Yale pennant
over his head ... there was a tiny Canadian flag pasted atop the
Yale crest.  He may also have had his tongue sticking out, but
I might be confused with a picture of Mark Messier holding the

Shades of James Watson!  That's exactly the way many workers have described
their misgivings about the Human Genome Project.  If you take a rigid 
definition of scientific research, the mere accumulation of data is not 
doing science.  One of the early arguments against the project were that the 
resources would be better used to focus on specific genetics-related 
problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence.  
The project can't be so narrowly defined or easily described now though.

It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system'
and like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and
return with a prize cure. Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited
and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all
sufferers.

This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals.
Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use
does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals
who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any
guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn't trumpet their
story all over the world?

As a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on Gingko seeds for
Meniere's? (To the original poster : what about trying for a trial of
that? It's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate
some of the discomfort. And you'd be helping answer the question for
future sufferers.)

  There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss.  The
 few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher

  Theoretically it really doesnt make sense either. The claim is that chromium
will increase muscle mass and decrease fat.  Of course, chromium is also used t
o cure diabetes, high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes(just
as well as anabolic steroids). Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :-)

""There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries""

By Mike Royko
Tribune Media Services


     On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings 
is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.
     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called 
Families USA.
      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe 
that doctors make too much money.
     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for 
physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be 
OK.
     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.
     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment 
and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign 
and are still simmering.
     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that 
earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority 
of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who 
do are stealing it from them.
     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  
Karl Marx lives.
     It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such 
as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to 
become a physician?
     If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should 
have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they 
should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much 
a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a 
doctor?
     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  ""How 
much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent 
grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order 
to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking 
courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and 
maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years 
of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth 
years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and 
(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) 
put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, 
depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in 
debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 
hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or 
more until they retire or fall over?""
     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably 
more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and 
Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have 
called together to remake America's health care.
     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far 
more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, 
social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is 
to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.
     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, 
many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the 
major cause of high medical costs.
     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  
Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for 
our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in 
a McDonald's?
     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become 
a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch 
cabbages.
     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or 
Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But 
instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, 
they might have been more honest if they had said:
     ""Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest 
problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, 
you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you 
guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; 
getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the 
microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into 
the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot 
victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease 
while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.
     ""You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single 
biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is 
amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.
     ""In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at 
your blubbery bods all day.
     ""So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and 
start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-
greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.""
     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, 
there is another solution: Don't use them.
     That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those 
spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands 
upon your head and declare you fit.
     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest 
pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit 
there, and pop in a couple of valves.
     You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that 
overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house 
than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and 
malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?
     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  
And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on 
how to give it its shots.
     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much 
pollsters should earn?

   Well, if that's the case in YOUR practice, I have a hard time 
   figuring out how you even managed to make it into the bottom half
   of your class, or did you create your diplomas with crayons?
 
   If someone runs a medical practice with only a 10% success rate,
   they either tackle problems for which they are not qualified to
   treat, or they have no conscience and are only in business for
   fraudulent purposes.

   OTOH, who are we kidding, the New England Medical Journal in 1984
   ran the heading: ""Ninety Percent of Diseases are not Treatable by
   Drugs or Surgery,"" which has been echoed by several other reports.
   No wonder MDs are not amused with alternative medicine, since
   the 20% magic of the ""placebo effect"" would award alternative 
   practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine...

I was just wondering if exercises specific to particular regions of the

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
one way or another on hidden candida infections.  I can
understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid
demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.
(To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past
failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
hidden candida infection.  There have been quite a few, and the
proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)

On the other hand, I am happy to read that some people are
sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by
suggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  The
doubters may be surprised.  (It has happened before.)

I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or
another.  (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am the
one who is currently ignorant.)  But I find this the most honest
route, and so I am happy with it.

A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital
because of suspected meningitis.  Serious business.  They wanted to do
a lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisite.

I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned
from the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CT
lab had been very unpleasant to her.

To begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the
machine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the
machine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you may
have a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put into
this big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what is
going to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her
hand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with
annoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IV
catheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained
of the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare
without any words of explanation.

Is there anything I can do about these pigs ?

I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day
out.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative.
But this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to help
sick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior.
Fortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of the
people who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and that
sort of thing.  They don't need this kind of shit.

Also, since I named the hospital involved, I should also point out that
neither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion
of any of the other personnel at NCMH.

Thanks for listening,

        Heck, I seem to feel like that *every* time I eat out. Including

I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity
which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring
from the diet.  The theory -- which was backed up by interesting anecdotal
results -- is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these
chemicals than other people.  I don't remember any connection being made
with seizures, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an all-natural diet.

I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as
hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not
be investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by 
figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought
""virtually impossible to test for.""

Indeed, I would be surprised if ""candida overbloom"" were such a
phenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signature
byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the 
extent of recent infection.  I realize this might get quite 
tricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient
or uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as 
""virtually impossible.""

Food products can get through breast milk and cause allergies in the
young.  Since the son is allergic it would be best not to go to
bottle feedings, but rather eliminate foods from mother's diet.  Your
pediatrician should be able to give you a list of foods to avoid.

Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors

Although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically
tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle
berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in
such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, 
Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle
berry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids 
(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste
sour as well.

Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a
diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin
pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such
substances would taste sweet without providing many calories.

A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.
We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted
extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We 
awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]

There's a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shopping
mall, offering free examinations.  Part of the process involves a
multiple-jointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer-
sounding voice ""digitize left PSIS"" ""digitize right PSIS"" ""digitize
C7"" ""please stand with spine in neutral position"".  I'm wondering
whether this doesn't really measure anything and the computer voice
is to impress the victims, or whether it is measuring something
that chiropractors think is useful to measure.

The areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little 
fat.  I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick
it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  I'm not fat, just
have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch
to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it
still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  
muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be
best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although
some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent 
irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, 
wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the
puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to prevent
irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to
do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the 
spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,
and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 "" apart.)

This is from experience, so I hope it'll help you.  (I have
diabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)

Its bogus.  See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).

You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the
Classic Example, but there are probably others.

Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By
looking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises
you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.

The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:

1: How does it work?

2: What evidence is there?

The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to
evaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on
reflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the
organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are
supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or
energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.
(Always beware the words ""channel"" and ""energy"" in any spiel put out
by an alternative practitioner.)

The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is
anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in
mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of
rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done
and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.

The word ""licensed"" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by
whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and
requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong
plants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove
and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license
extends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be
told that it means ""(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist"".

BTW, the usual term is ""herbalist"".  Why use a different word?

Antihistamines have been the active ingredient of OTC sleep aids for
decades.  Go to any drugstore and look at the packages of such sleep
aids as Sominex, Nytol, etc.  The active ingredient is:
diphenhydramine, the same antihistamine that's in Benadryl.

                       Gonorrhea -- Colorado, 1985-1992
                       ================================
                   SOURCE: MMWR 42(14)   DATE: Apr 16, 1993

     The number of reported cases of gonorrhea in Colorado increased 19.9% 
from 1991 to 1992 after declining steadily during the 1980s. In comparison, in 
the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall 
decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in 
gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of 
this disease from 1985 through 1992. 
     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department 
of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, 
reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively 
(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics 
(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases 
with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% 
of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by 
age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or 
equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all 
reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the 
largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age 
group-specific rate (639 per 100,000). 
     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver 
metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the 
state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area 
occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods 
considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. 
     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among 
men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in 
the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits 
by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases 
diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, 
the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised 
94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among 
self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, 
respectively). 
     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, 
university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted 
to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea 
culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 
23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the 
fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). 
     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and 
Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks

increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado 
increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, 
the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for 
whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) 
(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 
1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases 
increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 
may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more 
complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH 
surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea 
cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories 
suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. 
However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning 
laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the 
gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. 
     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in 
Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a 
recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs 
(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area 
coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires 
further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated 
previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) 
-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom 
gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, 
and gang affiliation. 
     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the 
national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective 
19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for 
gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at 
greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-
specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as 
socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. 
     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, 
interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting 
partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at 
increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black 
males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio

announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in 
schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted 
primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to 
perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational 
interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of 
members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders 
and health-care providers.

                Effectiveness in Disease and Injury Prevention
            Impact of Adult Safety-Belt Use on Restraint Use Among
            Children less than 11 Years of Age -- Selected States,
                                 1988 and 1989

     Motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and 
young adults in the United States and account for more than 1 million years of 
potential life lost before age 65 annually (1). Child safety seats and safety 
belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 
states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety 
belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by 
an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major 
cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of 
occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for 
those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In 
addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to 
use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between 
adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints 
for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC 
analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this 
study. 
     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 
18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, 
random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury 
Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 
(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent 
was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for 
that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in 
this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than 
consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). 
Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software 
for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates 
and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined 
by p values of less than 0.05. 
     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six 
(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no 
law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, 
and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a 
vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse 
of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary 
enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a 
safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection

Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states 
used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. 
The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law 
requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law 
(no-law states). 
     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not 
consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and 
adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square 
test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus 
43.2%, respectively). 
     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 
year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than 
consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported 
high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age 
(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for 
adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-
occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% 
for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of 
consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult 
safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age 
groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). 
     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded 
that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, 
higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with 
increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated 
with increased adult safety-belt use (8). 

Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National 
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. 

Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others 
indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely 
to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these 
nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit 
other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater 
risk for motor-vehicle injury (10). 
     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with 
child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs 
should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low 
educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such 
programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve 
low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are 
directed at parents with young children. 
     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In 
addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as

they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, 
those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do 
not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety 
belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and 
safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may 
increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- 
the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the 
highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

 SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES
                               IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC 
                        AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88 

     Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance 
systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects. 
     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance 
in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for 
the years 1983-1988. 
     Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program 
and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-
based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The 
prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-
1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan 
Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, 
sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. 
     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal 
alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the 
kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general 
diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand 
limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are 
probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these 
defects are relatively easy to diagnose. 
     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy 
termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, 
the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be 
related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene 
pool, or random variation. 
     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several 
collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in 
the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on 
the impact of prenatal diagnosis. Authors: Jane Schulman, Ph.D., Nancy

                      INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89

     Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza 
virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually 
from October through May. 
     Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance 
conducted from October 1988 through May 1989. 
     Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices 
of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO 
collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza 
viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and 
territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. 
Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received 
throughout the year. 
     Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B 
viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency 
overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted 
over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices 
of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were 
similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of 
identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype 
increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the 
1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were 
reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza 
A(H1N1). 
     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of 
influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the 
importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since 
amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. 
     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced 
throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make 
informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual 
surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates 
for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.

                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies

Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-
ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been 
developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), 
embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, 
these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive 
technology (ART) procedures. 

Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or 
pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility 
management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to 
proceed with one of the ART procedures. 

Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility 
service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and 
Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in 
ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients 
in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the 
traditional therapies. 

The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our 
Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the 
realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: 

o in vitro 
o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube 
  transfer 
o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. 
This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed 
towards improved success of these technologies.

                           Future Areas of Research

In addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the 
management of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist 
couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary 
disease. 

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then 
subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA 
amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. 

There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by 
other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and 
hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ 
hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of 
which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit 
sex-linked disorders. 

The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that 
it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility 
of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth 
of affected children.

               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the
                           Management of Infertility

The following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona 
Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. 

     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our 
Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of 
unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and 
the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred 
to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under 
strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being 
processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our 
andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-

assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to 
perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically 
stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing 
hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo 
lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs 
obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic 
egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, 
we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our 
Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  
     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal 
deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male 
factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall 
success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per 
cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 
IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. 
     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is 
disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological 
factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well 
recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous 
ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle 
attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant 
of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an 
Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of 
traditional therapies. 
     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not 
been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs 
available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates 
significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; 
and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is 
unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our 
Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may 
be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that 
fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant 
proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, 
the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our 
program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs 
of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. 

     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, 
usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves 
introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian 
tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization 
occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, 
with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for 
transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in 

HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26
Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993

which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such 
pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility 
and/or idiopathic infertility.    
     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 
indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained 
with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 
percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might 
expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our 
program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while 
substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the 
patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing 
a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing 
general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from 
obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, 
and the developmental competency of resultant embryos. 
     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial 
environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between 
January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT 
cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. 
     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when 
embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. 
This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for 
success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical 
issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated 
by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from 
both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs 
should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. 
     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, 
is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but 
who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in 
combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 
percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the 
procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under 
the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm 
through enzymatic digestion. 
     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 
percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly 
relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. 
Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques 
for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such 
efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology 
offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to 
establish conception.

    Recurrent Volvulus
    -------------------
    
 This is regarding recurrent volvulus which our little boy
 has been suffering from ever since he was an infant. He had

 to be performed one year after, when he was two years old.
 He turned three this February and he is still getting
 afflicted by this illness, like having to get hospitalised
 for vomitting and accompanying stomach pain.He managed
 not having a third surgery so far.
 
 *  	One thing me and my wife noticed is that his affliction
 	peaks around the time he was born, on nearabouts, like in
 	March every year.  Any significance to this?
 
 *	Why does this recur? Me and my family go through severe pain
 	when our little boy have to undergo surgery. Why does surgery
 	not rectify the situation? 
 
 *	Also, which hospital in US or Canada specialize in this malady?
 
 *	What will be a good book explaining this disease in detail?
 
 *	Will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of 
 	recurrence?
 
 *	As time goes on, will the probability of recurrence go down
 	considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably
 	less prone to attacks? Or is this assumption wrong?
 
 *	Any help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated.

Insomnia is a known, but relatively infrequent, side-effect of
diphenhydramine.  

For most people, this does not occur.  On the other hand, most people
can build up a tolerance to an antihistamine with extended use.
(Allergy sufferers are often switched from one antihistamine to
another to avoid this.)

>greatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some
>claim their heart ""skipped"" beats once in a while.

Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed
face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular
pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in
the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are
sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,
one can get too much of a good thing.

>Some reacted with headache, 

Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased
heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,
essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency
her, necessarily.


>some stomach ache.

Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not
necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting
occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has
eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the
list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an
enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly
ache) would be expected.


> Some had watery eyes or running nose,


These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar
to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious
compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible
some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the
symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets
can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be
necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person
was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration
and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from
simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.
 
> some
>had itchy skin or rashes. 

People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends
upon what it is about the compound that ""pisses off"" their body.
Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many
people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an
histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,
causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an
allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that
contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can
perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it. 

>More serious accusations include respiration 
>difficulty 

See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory
problems are not serious. They can be deadly.

and brain damage. 

The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system
controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling
the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,
and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.


>Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
>suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food
poisoning. 

Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,
say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus
too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,
plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days
before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of
things.

But it might be the MSG. 

>if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.

If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably
stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.


Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their
responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.

               (1) Obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same 
                   kind.  [Some kinds might work better that others.]

               (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight 
                   and number.

               (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper 
                   for three or four weeks.

               (4) Separately incinerate both groups.

               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of 
                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least 
                   SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]

               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for 
                   mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the 
                   sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier 
                   mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen, 
                   hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..]

          
               BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our

               Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with 
          carbon, such as ""horsetail"" extract, or radishes) can SPEED 
          HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much 
          faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).  
          
               Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-
          organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen, 
          oxygen, hydrogen, etc.. 
          
               The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms,

I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and
that it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the
greater volume. My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart rate
and PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate is
associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its
size. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the
effects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, she
asserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when
exercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners. 

So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart
patients. Isn't that strange, though? Are there any not-so-beneficial
aspects to athlete's heart? Is it all good?

Not worried, just curious,
-Larry C.

I beg to differ.  Chronic *active* hepatitis implies that the disease
remains active, and generally leads to liver failure.  At the very
minimum, the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes (what some
call ""transaminitis"").  Chronic *persistant* hepatitis simply means that
the patient has HbSag in his/her blood and can transmit the infection, but
shows no evidence of progressive disease.  If I had to choose, I'd much
rather have the persistant type.

Years ago when I was an intern, an obese young woman was brought into
the ER comatose after having been reported to have grand mal seizures
why attending a ""corn festival"".  We pumped her stomach and obtained
what seemed like a couple of liters of corn, much of it intact kernals.  
After a few hours she woke up and was fine.  I was tempted to sign her out as
""acute corn intoxication.""

That's fine.  These words have multiple meanings.

As a self-proclaimed atheist, I believe that *some* conceptions
of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and I lack
belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no
reason for me to believe in these.  I usually use the word
agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of
a god is unknown inherently unknowable.  Note that this is a
positive belief that is quite different from not believing in a
god; I do not believe in a god, but I also do not believe the
agnostic claim.

    Do you swim nude in a public swimming pool?  :)  I doubt sperm can

No, he does not exclusively treat LD patients.  However, in some parts of the
country, you don't need to be known as an LD ""specialist"" to see a large
number of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem of
underdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just
about every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year,
he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not
the only orthopedists in the town.

Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the
*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage
manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by
neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem
we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD
patient.

He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the
patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to
the knees).

Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.

	A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically
every few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extreme
tiredness followed by:

	1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows,
	knees, and hips.
	2. generalized muscle pains
	3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears
	4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day
	5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral
   retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (She
        isn't diabetic--they checked.
	6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone
	   poles do not appear to be straight)
	7. loss of peripheral vision.
 	
	Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something 
called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The only
thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  At
times she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg
the symptoms become acute again.

	She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming
worse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs she
has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop
it.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in 
advance.  Kathy Turner

I've had cold sores in the past.  But they have always been in the

Can cold sores appear anywhere around the mouth (or body)?

Is there a medical term for cold sore?

Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon, I think that the best clinical 
trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal 
candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the 
frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the 
candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus 
should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the 
intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to 
oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the 
lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really 
amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.


The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all 
conventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if 
conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard 
medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?
The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very 
important one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria 
after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason 
to dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply 
and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).

I agree that some specialties have gotten way out of line.  The main
problem is the payment method for procedures rather than time distorts
the system.  I hope they will fix that.  But I'm afraid, as usual,
the local doc is going to take the brunt.  People grouse about paying
$50 to see their home doctor in his office, but don't mind paying
$20,000 to have brain surgery.  They think their local doc is cheating
them but worship the feet of the neurosurgeon who saved their life.
What they don't realize is that we need more local docs and fewer

I was there in 1976.  I suppose it must have died out since 1946,
then.  Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in
the employ of the NHS.  Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities
refused to hire any homeopaths.  A similar law in the US allows
chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one
there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor.
There are a lot of Britons on the net, so someone should be able to
tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you.

The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in
Hearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other
'new' technology for hearing aids.

The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and
appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that
a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and
programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of
the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help
out in 'noisy' situations.

The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the
spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),
apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in
the low frequencies, while the important consonant information
(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are
treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have
also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call
'abnormal growth of loudness'.

This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I
think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you
exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit
becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach
the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means
that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high
end for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively
less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.
You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially
differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially
for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls
off a cliff).

Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low
and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency
information because of high volume of low frequency components.
Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech
and in simulated restaurant noise situations.

Thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question.  The
final diagnosis was Stress.  I did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment.
(Rachel receives all her medical care at Keller Army Hospital since she is a
military dependant, and the Army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments
as part of its regular health care.)  I am hoping that the arrival of (1)
Spring Break, and (2) College Acceptance Letters, will help.  *UNFORTUNATELY*
she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it
seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-(

Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for
spring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.

Thanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas.

I tried Prozac a few months ago, and had some insomnia from it, but no
anxiety or jitters.  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the
Prozac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe
because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a
20mg dose didn't work.

Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin
reuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some. 
Now I'm trying 100mg/day.  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than
Prozac.  I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zoloft
have to discontinue it because of side effects.  The only problem I'm
having is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the
Zoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next.

My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin
drugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too many
side effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.  If the serotonin drugs don't work
at all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine.

>...suggestions as to the next step?

Having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big
difference.  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs don't have much
experience in this area, and from what I've seen I'm inclined to believe
him.  I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at my
family practitioner's office.

Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor; what I know about this comes from talking to
my psychiatrist and reading sci.med.

Hello,

I am interested in trying this ""desensitization"" (?) method
against hay fever.
What is the state of affairs about this. I went to a doctor and
paid $85 for a 10 minute interview + 3 scratches, leading to the
diagnostic that I am allergic to (June and Timothy) grass.
I believe this. From now on it looks like 2 shots per week for
6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so. Each shot costs
$20. Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system, I would
call that a racket. We are not talking about rare Amazonian grasses
here, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office.
Apart from this issue, I was somewhat disappointed to find out
that you have to keep getting the shots forever. Is that right?
Thanks for information.

 New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at
Huntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported
 To: National Desk, Health Writer
 Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or
          800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research
          Institutes.

   LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing 
and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain
which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been
discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research
Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research
will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,
Radiology.
   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led
by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly
patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of
dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special
software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical
Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses
in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton
MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination
time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10
minutes.  By comparison, the current ""standard of care"" in testing
for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and
neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the
patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.
   In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS
exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including
AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's
disease.
   ""We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly
and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted
with either the MRS or PROBE software,"" said Dr. Ross, adding,
""this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and
intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease
causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.""
   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the
brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker
in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed
with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their
level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was
significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons
believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.
   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely
considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross
believes, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an
interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to
the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15
years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based
on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.
   ""Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate
Alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or
her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment
protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we
consider this test a major advancement in medicine,"" said Bruce
Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher
and a co-author of the study.
   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,
Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,
R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200
General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,
and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.

May issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or

   Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:

   What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of
the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist
Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of
memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,
loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.
   How many people does it affect?
   Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in
the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking
approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's
debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both
emotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the
most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every
year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.
   What are its signs and symptoms?
   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have
been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk
of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50
yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life
to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial
AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of
developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe ""forgetfulness""
caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School
of Medicine at New York University says ""whether forgetfulness is
a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree"" and
suggests the following criteria:

   -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is
      normal.
   -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.
   -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.
   -- Forgetting how to get home is serious.

   Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be
evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms
of dementia.

A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones, a
cyst on one kidney, and a kidney infection.  She was upset because her
condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill all
this time.  During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents'
HMO clinic, she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidney.
When she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by a
technician that they need to see the area from different views, but she
says that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldn't help
feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  She
is a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was
happening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would, she got
worried.
	Also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of her
and that they cannot do surgery until August or so.  It is now April...
She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids.  But she has to go to
classes.  She wonders why they have given her no medicine.  She plans to
call back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to these
questions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what I
could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems
o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this
or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.  She does plan to
get a second opinion, too. 

	I will pass info on to her.  It never hurts to get information

SF (and I""ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is

decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story

It depends on the cause of the pneumonia.  For treating bacterial
pneumonia in young otherwise-healthy non-smokers, erythromycin
is usually considered the antibiotic of choice, since it covers
the two most-common pathogens: strep pneumoniae and mycoplasma
pneumoniae.

My ENT doctor recommended surgery to fix my sinuses.  I have a very deviated
nasal septum (probably the result at least partially from several fractures).
One side has approximately 10-15% of normal flow.  Of course I have known this
for years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infection,
discovered during an MRI after a severe migraine.  A CT scan subsequently 
confirmed the problems in the sinuses.

He wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid, maxillary, frontal,
and sphenoid, along with nasal septoplasty.

He explained the procedure, and the risks.  What I would like to know is if
there is anyone out there who can tell me ""I had this surgery, and it helped
me""?

(I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't
really help them).

I am a moderately severe asthmatic.  ENT doc says large percentage see some
relief of their asthma after sinus surgery.  Also he said it is not unheard of
that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved.

I am 42.

Any relevant information is appreciated.

No, obviously talking about Research Assistants.  I favor a high protein,
low fat diet, barely adequate salary on a fixed time schedule, four hours

You need to use your shoulder muscles to push the mower. If you haven't been
doing much exercise, as I suppose you haven't, then a constant 20 minute
long effort can cause stiffness and cramps.

Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are
possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2
mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways,
however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their
ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.
The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of
sinus surgery, though.

About asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,
""Sinus Survival"", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases
of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage
(postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found
relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -
not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.

Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,
as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.

As an animal science student, I know that a number of animals transfer
immunoglobin to thier young through thier milk.  In fact, a calf _must_
have a sufficient amount of colostrum (early milk) within 12 hours to

24 hours the intestines are ""open"" to the IG passage.  My question is,

Yeah, but the problem with holding up the ""extra-rational"" examples as
exemplars, or as refutations of well founded methodology, is that you

A.  Folks, do we have an FAQ on tinnitus yet?

B.  As a lo-o-o-ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist
who has looked over the literature carefully I believe the following
are reasonable conclusions:

1. Millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus.
2. The cause it not understood.
3. There is no accepted treatment that cures it.
4. Some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit, but
there have be no reports--even anecdotal--of massive good results with
any of these experimental drugs.
5. Some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep.
6. Sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes
abates or goes away after a few months.
7. Aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people.
8. There is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the US.
9. One usually gets used to it.  Especially when concentrating on
something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed.
10.  Stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying, sometimes.
11.  I'm sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure, but there
is not.

Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese

I'm not going to quit eating something that I like just because

(3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized
example), and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with location
and time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying
external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances
caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will
be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.

Studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred
years old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few
tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the
investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some
hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding
the healing of broken bones, but not understood why.

Bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein
reanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as
when Volta invented the battery.  I personally don't care to revert to supernatural
cause to explain things we don't yet understand.

==============
Using a PC's keyboard on your workstation / compatibility issues

    Mini outline:
        1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port
        2. X terminals
        3. NeXT
        4. Silicon Graphics
        5. IBM RS/6000
	6. Other stuff

    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port

	If you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard
	(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding
	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation
	runs the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used
	PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable
	to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read
	the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.

	The two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.

	a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and
	even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server
	extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your
	server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings
	appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,
	you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,
	or bugging your vendor.

	kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.
	Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.

	Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.

    2. X terminals

	Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use
	PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all
	set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the
	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add
	extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around
	for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.

    3. NeXT

	NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop
	Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they
	were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of
	upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!

    4. Silicon Graphics

	Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and
	beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't
	believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not
	possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by
	upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more
	details.

    5. IBM RS/6000

	IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||
	Unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||
	cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||
	smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||
	it or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||
	works.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||
	told Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||
	anything new, please send me e-mail.				    ||
    
    6. Other stuff

	Some vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)
	support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your
	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can
	get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either
	from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in
	luck.  Contact the companies for more details.


Apple Adjustable Keyboard
    Apple Computer, Inc.
    Sales offices all over the place.

    Availability: February, 1993
    Price: $219
    Supports: Mac only

    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The
    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate
    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are
    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.

    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.
    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.

    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not
    directly attachable to the keyboard.

    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from
    TidBITS available there.


FlexPro Keyboard
    Key Tronic
    Phone: 800-262-6006
    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299
    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops

    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)
    Price: $489 (?)
    Supports: PC only (highly likely)

    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's
    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both
    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.
    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.

    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will
    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.


DragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)

    Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200
    Fax: 617-527-0372

    Shipping: Now.

    Price: DragonDictate-30K -- $4995 (end user system)
	   DragonWriter 1000 -- $1595 / $2495 (end user/developer system)
	   various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.
    
    Compatibility: 386 (or higher) PC only
		   (3rd party support for Mac)

	Free software support for X windows is also available -- your
	PC with Dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a
	serial cable or network.  The program is called a2x, and is
	available via anonymous ftp:

	soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.Z
	export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.Z (most current)

	If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows, you may want
	to ask for Peter Cohen, an salesman at Dragon who knows more about
	this sort of thing.

    Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products.
    Most (if not all) of them seem to run on PC's and compatibles
    (including PS/2's and other MicroChannel boxes).  They sell you
    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number
    of popular word processors and spreadsheets.

    Each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions
    to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  Multiple
    people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file
    for each person.  You still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.
    On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between
    words.  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.
    I don't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000.

    The DragonDictate-30K can recognize 30,000 words at a time.
    The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.

    Dragon's technology is also part of the following products
    (about which I have no other info):

	Microsoft Windows Sound System (Voice Pilot)
	IBM VoiceType
	Voice Navigator II (by Articulate Systems -- for Macintosh)
	EMStation (by Lanier Voice Products -- ""emergency medical workstation"")

    Shipping: Now.

    Supports: Mac, IBM PC (serial port -- native keyboard port version
    coming very soon...).  No other workstations supported, but serial
    support for Unix with X Windows has been written.  PC and Mac are
    getting all the real attention from the company.

    A chording system.  One hand is sufficient to type everything.
    The second hand is for redundancy and increased speed.

    Mark Roggenbuck (contact)

    Supports: PC and Mac

    Shipping: In beta.  ""Big backlog"" -- could take 3+ months.

    Price: $2000/unit (1 unit == 2 pods). (new price!)			    ||

    Each hand has its own ""pod"".  Each of the four main fingers has five
    switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down.  The thumbs have
    a number of switches.  Despite appearances, the key layout resembles
    QWERTY, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  The idea is
    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  The whole pod
    tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

    Jeffrey Szmanda (Vice President -- contact)

    Shipping: Now.

    Supports: PC (and Mac???)						    ||
    
    Planned future support:
	IBM 122-key layout (3270-style, I believe)
	Sun Sparc
	Decision Data
	Unisys UTS-40
	Silicon Graphics

	Others to be supported later.  The hardware design is relatively
	easy for the company to re-configure.

    Price: $690, including one system ""personality module"".		    ||

    The idea is that one keyboard works with everything.  You purchase
    ""compatibility modules"", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and
    then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.

    It's a three-piece folding keyboard.  The layout resembles the
    standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  Each
    section is on a ""custom telescoping universal mount.""  Each section
    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each
    individual to type in a natural posture.  You can rearrange the three
    sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  Each
    section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections
    flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

    Shirley Lunde (VP Marketing -- contact)

    Shipping: Now.

    Supports: PC.  Mac and Sun Sparc in the works.

    Price: $690.  Volume discounts available.  The $690 includes one foot
	pedal, one set of adhesive wrist pads, and a TypingTutor program.
	An additional foot pedal and other accessories are extra.

    The layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the
    keyboard is about the size of a normal PC keyboard -- slightly
    smaller.  Each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize
    finger travel.  Thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,
    backspace, etc.).

    You can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't
    allow the reconfig).

    Foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the
    keyboard (shift, control, whatever).

    letters a-j are combinations of dots 1, 2, 4, and 5.  Letters k-t are
    the same combinations as a-j with dot 3 added. Letters u, v, x, y, and
    z are like a-e with dots 3 and 6 added.  (w is unique because Louis
    Braille didn't have a w in the French alphabet.)

Nasopharyngeal cancer is (roughly, don't have references at hand) 20-30
times more prevalent in Chinese than Caucasians, particularly those Chinese
from southern China.  One province (or region) has an extraordinary excess. 
The Chinese and others have done major studies.  Some association with

The subject-line says it:  every time I run a fever, I get an amazing
rosy rash over my torso and arms.  Fortunately, it doesn't itch.

The rash  always comes on the day after the
fever breaks and no matter what the illness was:  cold, flu, whatever.
It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current
town, although I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.

Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever:
a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash.  A mild fever
seems to bring rashes that go away faster.  

Anybody know what might be causing this?  It's no more than an 
embarassment, but I'd be curious to know what's going on.  Am I carrying
some kind of fever-resistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out
its competition?

They aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in
humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and
cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.
Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:
my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-
grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife
had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-
grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous
farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of
childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,
contain quite a few gravestones like ""Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and
baby, May 6, 1853.""

More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have
direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.

>and now you want

It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of
reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.

Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine
design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.

My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack
in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.

We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although
I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked
them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.
I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly
indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting
until an emergency to give in.

And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.
We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main
decisions were really hers.

I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that

But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was
unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings.
In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings
have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem
all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious
permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all,
an esthetic consideration.

I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say
what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say
how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for
months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are 
every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.
Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start
azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug
in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics
about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of 
disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it
is worth.  

I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good 
patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things
can be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and
Colitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637

I think some essential information must be missing here, i.e., you must be
suffering from a condition which has caused immunosuppression.  There is
no indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy
person.  The oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms, and may
even help prevent the development of post-herpetic neuralgia, but I
certainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason.

To address your more general question, IV therapy does provide higher and
more consistently high plasma and tissue levels of a drug.  For treating a
serious infection this is the only way to be sure that a patient is
getting adequate drug levels.

I am reluctant to summarize it, for then you will have my opinion of what the

for you to take the trouble to go to the library and get the article.  The
title is ""The shot doctors"" and it appears on Pages 96-100 of the February,
1988 issue of Consumer Reports.  The following excerpt from the article may
entice you to read the whole article:

Why do you think Steere is doing this?  Isn't he acting in good faith?
After all, as the ""discoverer"" of Lyme for all intents and purposes,
the more famous Lyme gets, the more famous Steere gets.  I don't

Well, it is tragic what has happened to you, but it doesn't
necessarily make you the most objective source of information
about it.  If your whole life is focussed around this, you
may be too emotionally involved to be advising other people
who may or may not have Lyme.  Certainly advocacy of more research
on Lyme would not be out of order, though, and people like you
can be very effective there.

Reading this definition, I wonder: when should you recognize something

might have their own ideas of what constitutes a ""mistake"" and which

I'll probably get flamed for this, but when I was a kid we would go to
my uncles cabin on Middle Bass Island on Lake Erie. We always came home
with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had
burrowed into the skin). My mother would paint the bumps with clear
finger nail polish. This was repeated daily for about a week or so. The
application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of
the skin. All I can say is it worked for us. One word of caution
though. Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.

(If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me
toast.:)

I am very interested in investigations of starvation for improving health.
I am the young Russian reseacher  and have highest medical education
 and expierence in reseach work in biological field and would like
 to work on this problem.
Can anybody send me the adresses of the hospitals or Medical Centers where  
scientific problems of human starvation for the health are investigated?  
Also I would like to set scientific contacts with colleagues who
deals with investigations in this field.
I would be very appreciated anyone reply me.

     I posted about a ""pulse of (relaxation) electricity"".  I now think
it more like a pulse of ""relaxation"" or comfort than a pulse of
electricity.  It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling
of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.

     Another thing.  When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your
palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  Then you
relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  So,
you feel a ""shiver"" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat).
Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you
hear loudens.  (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down
in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  This
roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your
body.

     ""Shiver"" is not the word.  It may be called a mild vibration or quake.
What is this shiver and roam?  Can I use this to induce out-of-body
experience?

Looking in The Evolution of Anaesthesia by M.H. Armstrong Davison
(pub Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore 1965) I found the following
chronology:

""1853.  Charles-Gabriel Pravaz (1791-1853), inventor of the
galvanocautery, describes a glass syringe with tapered nozzle. This
syringe was intended to be used with a special trocar for injecting
ferric chloride into aneurysms, and thus to heal them by coagulation.

1853.  Alexander Wood (1817-84)  of Edinburgh invents the hypodermic
needle and adapts Pravaz's syringe for use with it.""

You might also be interested to read about the experiments of Sir
Christopher Wren in 1656, described by Oldenberg & Clarck in the
Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society in 1665. Using a
sharpened quill and a pig's bladder he injected opium, wine and beer
into the veins of dogs.

You'd have to purify the river water first.  I'm not sure how practical
that is with the Mississippi.  You'd better check with health agencies
along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river.  If
it is just microorganisms, those can be filtered or killed, but you
may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals.
Better be same than sorry.  Obviously, drinking the river without
processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites.

It is illegal to perform acupuncture with unsterilized needles. No licensed

Any one know when the heck these people send out their acceptance letters?
According to the med school admissions book theyre supposed to send out

I recently attended an allery seminar.  Steroid Nasal sprays were 
discussed.  Afterward on a one-on-one basis, I asked the speaker what if

Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is 
relevant for med students too.

Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically.
Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy, 
histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass 
memorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most 
med students are.

Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I 
have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like
thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have
never applied them to large amounts of ""data"".

Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or
cheap software?   

Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an
older student who returned to school this year, organization (another
one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success.

Please no griping about how all you have to do is ""learn"" the material
conceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strong

rote memorization.

	My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's
syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome.

	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for
hyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the
hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion
from it. 

	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level
but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous
endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the
hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).

I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an
abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. . 

I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia.

I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel
to New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology.

Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much
improvement in her condition over the past several months.

I have osteoarthritis, and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes
(type II, I guess--no insulin). 


I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really
surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. 
Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for
arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very
conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the
weight gain. 

For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle
and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about
eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. 
Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much
interest, like bread on the waters.


With this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can
suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.

Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a
balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which-
parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and
which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.

Is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly
understood?  Is it just that I'm used to pediatrician-talk (""It's strep;
give him this and he'll get well."") and so my expectations are too high?

I don't like the term ""quack"" being applied to a licensed physician David.
Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion).
I'll give you some examples.

	1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no 
	   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.

	2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid 
	   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.

	3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has 
	   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by 
	   the NCI.

These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should 
not committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of 
which result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal 
agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be 
having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of 
commission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to 
relieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,
others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a 
chance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the 
healer's oath, ""I will do no harm"".  But you know David that very few 
treatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a 
very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each 
physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some 
are very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive 
approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long 
as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake 
in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in 
the medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as 
quacks or even unethical.

What do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  
These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the 
frustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are 
really doing a pretty good job of providing ""alternative"" medicine.  But 
many lack any formal training and are in the ""business"" simply to make a 
few fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting 
competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative 
care area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find 
someone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of 
money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-
medical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the 
liscened physicians).

I hope that this clears things up David.

Certainly we don't have all the answers.  The question is, what is the
most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge?  The
scientific method has proven itself to be reliable.  The *only* reason
alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their
practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific
scrutiny, insisting that ""tradition"" or anecdotal evidence are
sufficient.  These have been shown many times in the past to be very
unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge.  Crook's ideas have
never been backed up by scientific evidence.  His unwillingness to do
good science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of his contentions.

I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to
be carcinogenic that ""it would not be legal in the U.S."".  I think that
naturally occuring substances (excluding ""controlled"" substances) are
pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additives
or other ""consumption"".  It's only when the chemists concoct (sp?) an
ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations.  Otherwise, if they 
really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything.
How in the world do you suppose it's legal to ""consume"" tobacco products
(which probably SHOULD be banned)?

Reading through the posts about Kirlian (whatever spelling)

I am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to
so-called ""paranormal"" stuff; but as far as I'm concerned, it is just
as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis.

I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
something, ANYTHING, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame

Where are your references?  I have been unable to find studies that state
that chromium ""cures diabetese"".  It can reduce the amount of insulin you
have to take.  ""High blood pressure"" - I have never heard of this claim
before.  ""... anabolic steroids"" - I have also never heard of this claim
before.  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth
for God knows what reason.  Did somebody piss you off at one time?

I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely
to make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component
of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an
important contribution to good health.  It is important to
exercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).

Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase
lean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the
statistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway.

Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of
the essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role
in ""sensitizing"" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin.
Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity
to insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose
weight (4).

Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards
protein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This ""protein sparing""
effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets
as insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle
and organ tissue.  By ""sensitizing"" muscle to insulin,
chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters
so that they ""burn"" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation
of lean body mass has an important long-term positive
effect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the
fat they've lost.

Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding
the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.
Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability
of food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin 
stimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say
that chromium picolinate increases metabolism.

In summary, you need to change your life style in order to
loose weight and stay healthy:

  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.
     - Eating fat makes you fat.

  B. Increase dietary fiber
     - low in calories; high in nutrients.

  C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week
     - burn calories.

  D. Take chromium picolinate daily
     - lose fat; keep muscle

This may have helped you, but I'm not sure it is good general
advice.  The odds that you are going to find some miracle with
your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge
for this or any other disease are slim.  When good answers to these
problems are found, it is usually in all the newspapers.  Until
then, spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical
problem may divert that energy from more productive things
in life.  A limited amount should be spent to assure yourself
that your doctor gave you the correct story, but after it becomes
clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine
has no good solution, perhaps the best strategy is to join
the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to
make a career out of it.

Precisely.  One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that
could be causing ""difficulty with his behavior"".  Standard practice would
be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist.  One would want to
rule out the possibility that the ""bad behavior"" is not psychiatric
illness at all.

First, I am not a doctor.  I know about this because I have been
through it.

It sounds like tonsilitis (lit. swollen tonsils).  Feel under your jaw
hinge for a swelling on each side.  If you find them, its tonsilitis.
I've had this a couple of times in the past.  The doctor prescribed a
weeks course of penicillin and that cleared it up.

In my case it was associated with glandular fever, which is a viral
infection which (from my point of view) resembled flu and tonsilitis
that kept coming back for a year or so.  There is a blood test for
this.

In conclusion, see a doctor (if you have not done so already).

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or
some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had
elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them
did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal
Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue
and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that
some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.

Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively
swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's
nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the
syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The
disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers
on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:
psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --
maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental
toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of
these.

There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try
different things, some of which seem to help.

Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.
Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.

Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)
diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good
doc.

Dyer is beyond rude. 

There have been and always will be people who are blinded by their own 
knowledge and unopen to anything that isn't already established. Given what 
the medical community doesn't know, I'm surprised that he has this outlook.

For the record, I have had several outbreaks of thrush during the several 
past few years, with no indication of immunosuppression or nutritional 
deficiencies. I had not taken any antobiotics. 

My dentist (who sees a fair amount of thrush) recommended acidophilous:

After I began taking acidophilous on a daily basis, the outbreaks ceased.
When I quit taking the acidophilous, the outbreaks periodically resumed. 
I resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then.

Funny about that... my wife (my girlfriend at the time) used to get sick 
after eating certain foods at various Asian restaurants, and never knew 
why.  She'd go pale, and sweaty and then vomit copiously.  A couple of us 
ventured a connection with MSG, and her response was: ""MSG?  What's that?"".  
It also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and 
chips... which I noticed (later) had MSG on the label.  Don't know about 
double blinds, but avoiding MSG has stopped her being sick at restaurants.

	Two thoughts.

	- I think that psychologically it will be easier for the next 
generation to accept genetic manipulation.  It seems that people frown
upon 'messing with Nature', ignoring our eons-old practice of doing just that.
Any new human intervention is 'arrogance and hubris' and manipulation
we routinely do is 'natural' and certainly 'not a big deal'.

	- Most interesting human traits will probably be massively
polygenetic and be full of trade-offs.  In addition, without a positive
social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts, having them won't
be the advantage it's made out to be.  Some people will certainly pursue it
as if it is the Grail, but we know how most of those quests turn out.

You probably mean ""RoHypnol"", a member of the benzodiazepine family,
chemical name is flunitrazepam. It is such a strong tranquilizer that it is
probably best refered to as a hypnotic, rather than a tranquilizer. Just one
pill will knock you on your ass. Side effects may be similar to valium, xanax,
serax, librium and other benzodiazepines.

I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in 1955.  There 
is a story about the Civil War about a soldier who was shot in the
groin.  The bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then entered
the abdomen of a young woman standing nearby.  Later,  when she (a young
woman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did
the honorable thing of marrying her.  According to this story, they lived
happily ever after.  
Perhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would come
into class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from about
3/8"" to 1/2"" over a 10 inch length).  He would say, ""Boys, do you know
what this is?  It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it's
used to unclog your penis when you have VD.  They just ram it up there
without an anesthetic!""  Needless to say this had a chilling effect.
I didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.  Later in life
as I perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexible
urethral sounds that are actually used, I could not escape thinking
that I might one day see, ""Reamer, Cock (style of Rau) .""

A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has
emphysema.  His lung capacity has decreased over time.  His father died
of the disease.  He works in woodworking.  I believe he has a very
occasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less.  He tells
me this..I've never seen him light up.  He has some pretty healthy
life style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapy
etc.  Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up.  I know really
nothing about the disease.  I believe it interferes with the lining
of the lung being able to exchange oxygen.  

Is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence?  If he were to give up smoking
entirely would that better his chances for recovery?  What are some 
modern therapies used in people with this disease?  I would appreciate 
any information.  Thanks.  amigan@cup.portal.com

[...]

   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION
   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What
   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.

   [Reproduced without permission]

	   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,
	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under
	the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,
	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if
	a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group
	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and
	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after
	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.
	   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a
	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.
	However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers
	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did
	actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not
	necessarily go hand in hand.
	   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining
	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.
	And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the
	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins
	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-
	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in
	the amount of food eaten afterward.

	   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing
	cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a
	host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government
	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing
	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.
	Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and
	after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm
	that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the
	Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with
	monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's
	Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration
	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a
	clean bill of health.
	   Granted, the FDA has set forth an ""acceptable daily intake"" of
	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed
	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take
	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of
	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,
	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...
	A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams
	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups
	of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content
	of selected foods omitted]
	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away
	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called
	phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000
	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential
	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child
	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause
	such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with
	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other
	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning ""Phenylketonurics:
	Contains Phenylalanine.""

And presumably this is a matter of degree; it must be common to prescribe
a drug that has _some_ chance of giving _some_ benefit, but not a high
probability of it, and/or not a large benefit.  Right?

If it were my wife, I would insist that a radiologist be involved in the
process.  Radiologist are intensively trained in the process of
interpreting diagnostic imaging data and are aware of many things that
other physicians aren't aware of.  Would you want a radiologist to
deliver your baby?  If you wouldn't, then why would you want a OB/GYN to
read your ultrasound study?


In my opinion the process should involve a OB/GYN and a radiologist.

Actually that is not how the pill works, but it *is* how the IUD works.
The oral contraceptive pill actually *prevents* ovulation from occuring
by providing negatve feedback to the pituitary gland, and thus preventing
the LH surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation.  With the IUD
what happens is that fertilization may occur, but the device prevents
implantation within the wall of the uterus (*not* the vagina).

I've recently listened to a tape by Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, in which he 
claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti-
cancer properties that he names antineoplastons.  Burzynski says that his 
work has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorable 
responses of his subjects during clinical trials.

What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski's research?  He 
paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an 
intolerant medical establishment, but I have no basis from which to judge 
his claims.  Two weeks ago, however, I read that the NIH's Department of 
Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski's 
work.  Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldn't investigate a 
treatment that didn't seem promising.

Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current 
status of his research would be appreciated.

I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(
toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well 
because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got 
into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium 
would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.
But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 
supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).

Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams 
per day).

	1. Review Article ""Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney 
	   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C"" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.
	   5(3):110-129(1985).

But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both 
glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this 
production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, 
but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.

	2. ""Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in 
	    patients with kidney stones"" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)
	    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary 
	    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.

	3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria"" Clin. Sci. 38
	   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day 
	   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.

For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is 
required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for 
oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is 
quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  
The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% 
of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable 
and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 
6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic 
acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the 
extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a 
very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. 
Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day 
increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg 
per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was 
increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose 
and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion 
before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average 
before supplementation.

B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There 
are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about 
yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the 
speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must 
have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then 
explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C 
challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your 
intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you 
take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient 
in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate 
kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets 
absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day 
showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309
-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase 
in urinary oxalate excretion.

	Here are the high oxalate foods:

	1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.
	   Contain at least 25mg/100grams

	2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, 
	   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.
	   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.

If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot 
of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points 
out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your 
intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being 
absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't 
have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for 
males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).
B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more 
per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  

The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day 
for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with 
this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 
requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that 
either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 
excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,
isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to 
supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that 
increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking 
birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the 
other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your 
dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone 
formation should be given B6 supplements.

One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your 
Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is

done though.

I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to
see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness
but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than
those with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked from
my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye)
which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get
an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To
control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since
I was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think
I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people
like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are
not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the
results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major
league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test
whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was ""better"" -
but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in
said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major
leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure
whether I'd believe her.)

I think we agree on much.  However the paragraphs above seem to repeat
uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of ""progress"" and
""rationality"" in science.  Since I've addressed these issues in this
newsgroup in the not too distant past, I won't go into them again now.

What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the
impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps
even the ""correct"") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around
having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and
petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that
sciences goes ""forward"" (and it is not clear what this means given the
context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational
and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then
weeded out via the ""critical function"" of science.  (Though why this critical
function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.
If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are
subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true
of the application of any ""critical function"" concerning replication.
This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an ""anything goes"" view.)

True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is
*not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have
resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply
do not generalize well to the actual history of science.

Hi there
I'm suffering from Sarcoidosis at present.  Although it's shown as a
chronic & rare tissue disorder, it is thankfully NOT life threatening.

The very worsed thing that can happen to a non-treated sufferer is
glaucoma.  My specialists are bombarding me with Prednisolone E.C. (a
cortico-steriod) and after four months at 20mg a day, it's totally done
away with my enlarged lymph glands, so somethings happening for the
good!

Cheers Nigel

MSG is mono sodium glutamate, a fairly straight forward compound. If it is
pure, the source should not be a problem. Your comment suggests that 
impurities may be the cause.
My experience of MSG effects (as part of a double blind study) was that the
pure stuff caused me some rather severe effects.

The symptoms I had were numbness of jaw muscles in the first instance

And also better, because a neurologist can make a differential
diagnosis between migraine, tension-type headache, cluster, benign
intracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other
headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.  A neurologist
can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the
diagnosis.

Sigh.  It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Even
after I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic
examination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis,
salted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask ""why can't you
order a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?""  Aunt Millie often gets
into the conversation, as in ""they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches
for years"", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or
whatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a
patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear
what your magic is.

Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.
Mind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,
but the patient feels like ""something is being done"" (as if the
hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were
""nothing""), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper
than CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.

It would help if you (and anyone else asking for medical information on
some subject) could ask specific questions, as no one is likely to type
in a textbook chapter covering all aspects of the subject.  If you are
looking for a comprehensive review, ask your local hospital librarian.

To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So
there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a
given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely
and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums
of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other
hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which
eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies
contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  ""You people call
THIS science?""   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both
these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  

Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor
appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is 
ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  


My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make
extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using
methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this
is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach
their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.

Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before
the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is
famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later 
mathematicians did prove them, of course.)  

I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not
so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a 
matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of 
incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to 
objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an
essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step 
of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward 
that goal then one is not doing science.)

When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and
seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also
worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further
investigation.  

In article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: 
> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that
> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  

Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable
amount of effort in a ""serious scholarly investigation"" such as I
suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately 
specific question to try and answer.  

The ""science"" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science 
currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  
I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use 
of ""reason and observation.""

One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether
in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced
practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  

Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with
the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there 
is any existing research related to this question.

For one week, she probably wants to see how you react to the diet. If it
changes anything. 

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you
had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave
cooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's
hard to digest anyway. 

For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal ""last"" longer eat pasta or
rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe
smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the
baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How
tight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses 
your middle. Be sure not to ""suck in"" your stomach when sitting, again it
will put pressure on the digestive tract. 

Try laying on your sides, back,
and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.
Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby
""turn"" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.
When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the
diaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my
second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he
didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.


Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe
she just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. 
But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something
to be avoided if possible. 

Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My
first pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble.
Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better
chance of carrying their baby. (grain of salt here) 

Good luck

Indeed, an extreme example.  It came ""out of nowhere.""  The connection
Kekule saw between it and his problem is fortunate but not extraordinary.
I, for example, often receive/conjure solutions (hypotheses for solutions) 
to my everyday problems at moments when I appear to myself to be occupied 
with activities quite removed.  Algorithms for that new software feature come
when I trample the meadow on my occasional runs.  Alternative (better>) ways 
to instruct and rear my sons arrive while I weed the garden.  I'll swear I am 
not thinking about any of it when ideas come.   

These ideas are not the stuff of ""great"" discoveries, of course, but my
connecting them to particular problems is fraught with deliberation and
occasional fits of rationality.

Yes.  And he was lucky to have such a colorful, vivid image.  I, alas, will
never figure out why returning worms to the loose soil of my garden brought, 
""have him count objects instead of merely count"" to mind regarding my 2 
year-old's fledging arithmetic skills.

I said that I PERSONALLY had other people order the EXACT SAME FOOD at

I eat lots of Chinese food - I LOVE Chinese food.  I've just learned
the following

IF I get food at one of the restaurants that DOES NOT USE MSG or

IF I prepare the food myself without MSG or 

IF I order the food from a restaurant that will hold the MSG (and I
never get soup unless it's from a restaurant that cooks without the
MSG)

I DO NOT GET A REACTION!!!!

OKAY

DO YOU UNDERSTAND!!!!

I GET A REACTION FROM MSG

I DO NOT GET A REACTION WHEN THERE IS NO MSG

If you're having trouble understand this, please tell me which of the
words you do not understand and I'll look them up in the dictionary
for you.

I think I can explain the ""missing part of a leaf"" story.

I have actually seen a reproduction of that particular Kirlian
photograph, in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts of
Kirlian photography.  ""That particular photograph"" ... ?  That's
right, the effect has been observed only once.  Even the writers of
the book were inclined to disbelieve in it.  

I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing
a whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo.
For his next experiment, he cut the leaf in half, put one half down
between the same two plates, and took another K. p.  The
""missing half"" effect was created by water, oils, etc. left behind 
after the first photo.

This explanation must be tentative, because after all I wasn't there
when it happened.

A brain abscess is an infection deep in the brain substance.  It is
hard to cure with antibiotics, since it gets walled off, and usually,
it needs surgical drainage.

It seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Who
has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could
it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing
to be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these
vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical
research is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that these
interests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC
has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight.

As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH didn't
find them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! I
tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after
being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting
like hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their
survival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna-
tive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find-
ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless.

There's no data that sugar-coated cereals cause seizures.  I haven't
even seen anything anecdotal on it.  Given how common they are eaten
- do you know any child or adolescent who *doesn't* eat the stuff? -
I think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now.
Also, there's nothing weird in those cereals.  As far as the brain
is concerned (except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such as
galactosemia), sugar is sugar, regardless if it is coated on cereal,
sprinkled onto cereal, or dissolved in soda, coffee or whatever.

There was some interest a few years ago in aspartame lowering
seizure thresholds, but I don't believe anything ever came of it.

Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly?  Does 
short-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after
the use of the drug?  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized
and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks.  Although the
drug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly
senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone
and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance.  It
seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the
course of just one and one-half months.  I have to believe that the
combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part
catalysts for this.  Any comments?

I know that there is MSG sensitivity.  When I eat foods with MSG I get
very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. I first
experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese
food almost everyday for lunch.  Now I can't tolerate MSG at all.  I can
notice immediately when I have eaten any.  I try to avoid MSG completely.

Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing
the exact same rash on their hands.  I couldn't understand why because I
don't MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese (I still
love it).  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where
one of their favorite foods.  One of the main ingredients in the flavor
packets is MSG.  Now I look at all labels.  You would be surprised at
places you find MSG.

There are two different mechanisms here:  toning of muscles and reduction of
fat.  Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles
exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching
arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise
also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally
distributed over the entire body.  There is no way to ""spot reduce"" body fat
other than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is
genetically determined.  Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like ""fat"",
so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the ""fat""
is ""changing"" into ""muscle"", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally
separate, and one does not ever ""change into"" the other.

Hmm.  This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack
therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed
laetrile (whether licensed or not) as a quack.  There are unethical
behaviors (such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees)
which I would not lable as quackish, but prescribing known ineffective
therapies seems to me to be one of the hallmarks of a quack.

Perhaps diluting the rubbing alcohol in some water, until you

Hi,
I am not sure where to post this message, please contact me if I'm way off
the mark.
On 19.3.93 my wife went to her General Practitioner (Doctor). He mentioned
an article from a medical journal that is of great interest to us. He had
read it in the previous three months but has been unable to find it again.
The article was about Whiplash Injury/Cervical Pain. It mentions the use of
a MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imagery) machine as a diagnostic tool and the work
of a neurosurgeon who relived cervical pain.
This article is most likely in an Australian medical journal. I very much
want to obtain the name of the article, journal and author because the case
matches my wife. We would very much appreciate anyone's help in this matter
via email preferably.

EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove 
calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such 
use).  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung 
disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side
-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also 
binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when 
EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that 
were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove 
calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C 
and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra 
vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium 
from the plaques).

The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably 
can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns 
with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.

	1. ""Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review""
	   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with 
	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. 

	2. ""The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular 
	    disease"" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the 
	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be 
	    overemphasized.  This is a review article.

	3. ""Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis 
	   in cholesterol-fed rabbits"" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990).  
	   Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of 
	   plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol 
	   added to their normal food.

Since EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for 
the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.

	This is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  There were 
	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology
	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'

    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography
    is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the
    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic
    or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's
    City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research 
    named A. J. Ellison.

    After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison
    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we
    calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of
    the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than
    'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing
    in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited
    value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and
    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be
    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and
    usually also tracer chemicals.

Hi,

I've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few 
concerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing 
her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) 
and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every 
4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. 
As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that 
though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she 
mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 
weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had 
an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no 
problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain 
in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very 
difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or 
move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for 
when I do need to go out.) 

Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from 
the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about 
2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  
(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating 
very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well 
now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile 
related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my 
upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I 
was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because 
it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  
no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I 
ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had 
turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if 
I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it 
wasn't as much of a problem.

So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid 
fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware 
of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have 
been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat 
foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  

But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat 
except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, 
fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I 
should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only 
have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( 
potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in 
a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or 
steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have 
some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if 
I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it 
from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if 
she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her 
recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on 
cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She 
originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the 
entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I 
started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and 
she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also 
asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them 
are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, 
and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did 
want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be 
temporary for that one week. 

What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I 
would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying 
that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she 
assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that 
because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to 
use the energy from the food I do eat. 

Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm 
truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet 
because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few 
minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I 
don't find any foods satisfying.

Thanks

I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just after
I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training
day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of
the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale,
and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that
heavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few 
minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with
chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But
I dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued
arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my
usual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of
the day.

My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal --
my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal
and it is no longer cold. 

Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through
my brain.  I'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise
regimen.  So that can't be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bar
cause these symptoms (I hope)?

Has this happened to anyone else?
Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.  Does it come with age?

Thanks,
Tom

Does anyone know of any studies done on the long-term health effects of a
man's vasectomy on his female partner?

I've seen plenty of study results about vasectomy's effects on men's health,
but what about women? 

For example, might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for,
say, cervical cancer?  Adverse effects from sperm antibodies?  Changes in the
vagina's pH?  Yeast or bacterial infections?

Outside of study results, how about informed speculation?

Thanks in advance for your help!

First, let me offer you my condolences.  I've had kidney stones 4 times 
and I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see 
a doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the
only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a
urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones
are extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it
out.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she
absolutely won't see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps
an over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor.
Kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  She should be x-rayed 
to make sure there is not a serious problem.

Recently, I completed a 2 week juice fast (with 3 days of water) and had
two colonics as part of it.  My motivation was primarily spiritual, to
de-toxify from all the crap I've been putting in my body (not like thats
enough to clean it all out but it did have an effect).  Personaly, I
didn't find it an uncomfortable experience (the colonic), lost about
15lbs of beer belly (which hasn't come back over the last month), and
feel great.  One of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was
seeing my 90 year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis (?) from
years of indulgence.

Not everything that goes in comes out, and personaly I don't mind giving
my body a hand once in a while.

Just my experience,

No, they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently, and I
thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.  

The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.
The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point
the thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear
to straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then
pushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.
It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on 
yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,
and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.  

I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,
and she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give
me some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion
feels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly
on one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to
the company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company
had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end
of the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior
to reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree
of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.

I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the
probe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you
have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button
to get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect
that many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for
yet another reason.

In short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believe
it doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature.

First off, I would consider the severity of the pain. I had stones
several years ago, and there's now way I could have made it without
heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the
hospital. I was told that there was nothing that I could take that would
dissolve them. If the stones are passible, the best thing she could do
is drink LOTS of water, and hope that they pass, but every time they
move a little, the pain will be excrutiating. I was told by my doctor
at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (Yes,
by a male doctor, so I'm sure some of you women will disagree). I'd
really like to know the truth in this, so maybe some of you women who
have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in.

 Well, yes.  That was a part of my point.  Aspirin has its problems, but
in some situations it is useful.  Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking
anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea
of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,
additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are
not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that
in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.
   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in
some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use
that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have
when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested
by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because
long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.

Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon
cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  In
particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book ""Colon Cleansing for
Health and Longevity"" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very
similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics,
along with certain orally ingested ""debris-loosening agents"", boosts
the immune system to a significant degree.

He also plugs a unique appliance called the ""Colema Board"", which
facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  It sells for over
$100 from a California-based company.  He also plugs Vitra-Tox
products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash,
supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its
bulkiness.

If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its
particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very
interested to hear about research and personal experience.

This article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon
fasting and cleansing through a ""ritual"" system of purification.

Do you believe that any quacks exist?  How about quack diagnoses?  Is
being a ""licensed physician"" enough to guarantee that someone is not
a quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack,
other people shouldn't say so?  Can you give an example of a
commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis,
or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
need to worry about unscrupulous ""healers"" taking advantage of
people.

	numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower (roughly 5 to 10 
	percent lower).  I find the following range for whole blood in
	FUNDAMENTALS OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY: N. W. Teitz, editor; W. B.
	Saunders, 1987:

	Human glucose (whole blood, fasting levels) --> 60 - 95 mg./dL.

>Which are the strips calibrated for?  (Obviously they measure whole blood)

	Indeed, they do measure whole blood levels, although they are not
	as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory.  One problem is
	that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the
	sample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.  According to Teitz,
	however, results compare ""reasonably well"" with laboratory results,
	although ""values below 80 mg./dL. tend to be lower with strip tests,
	whereas values above 240 mg./dL. can be very erratic.""

>What is the conversion factor between human plasma glucose and
>whole blood (pin prick) glucose concentration?

	As stated above, whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 
	percent lower than serum levels.  Sample freshness will affect
	whole blood levels, however.  I don't believe there is a well-
	defined ""conversion factor,"" since cell metabolism will affect
	samples to varying degrees.  The serum/plasma test is much 
	preferred for any except general ""ball park"" testing.

Herman, I would think you of all people would/could distinguish
between ""health"" and ""treatment of disease."" All the prevention
medicine people preach this all the time. You cannot buy health.
You can buy treatment of disease, assuming you are lucky enough
to have a disease which can be treated. A rich person with a
terminal disease is a bit out of luck. There is no such thing
as ""adequately covered"" and there never will be. 

And for what it's worth, I'll be the first to admit that all my
patients die.

	I'm not sure who the ""original respondent"" was but to
reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum, just
as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen
in our case, reddish in certain amphibia), just as the hoseshoe crab
_Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of
the spectrum etc.  It is a common misconception to confound wavelength
specificity with being color sensitive, however the two are not
synonymous.
	So in sum and to beat a dead horse:
	(1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of
absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength,
the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_.
	(2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral
sensitivities and are not any more ""color sensitive"" than are rods,
ommatidia or other photoreceptors.
	(3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which
sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are
""processed centrally"".  (The handwave is intentional)

	I've worked and published research on rods and cones for over
10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can ""detect color""
is frustrating.  But don't take my word for it.  I'm reposting a few
excellent articles together with two rather good but oldish color
vision texts.

The fantasy was that he had found something of fundamental importance to
one of the hot questions of the day ('77).  He really had very little
reason to believe it, other than raw hope.  By fantasy, I certainly don't
mean Velikovskian manias.

I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising.
That's not what I'd quibble about.  What I'd like to know are Toricelli's
reasons for doing his experiment; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons,
but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem.  It may be
impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad if
it is so.  One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone
rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's (and other people's) notes, and has
discovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  Pasteur never
publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams are
right there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready for
anyone to read.  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous
reasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because I was mad at
a colleague for a poorly-written claim (I disproved the claim).

Of course, Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where the
fantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be right
in the end.

I think the question is: What is extra-scientific about this?  

It has been a long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on
where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered
legitimate hypotheses.  The point, in short, is this: hypotheses and
speculation in science may come from wild flights of fancy, 
daydreams, ancient traditions, modern quackery, or anywhere else.

Hi Stephen
Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing
a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the
external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some 
hearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your
own, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and
fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen
peroxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)
and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  
firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the
tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl 
under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy
a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever
you may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try
adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up
the wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also
safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse
it out.
Good Luck

Okay Mr. Dyer, we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and
ability to insult people. You're a wonderful speaker and an adept politician.
However, I believe that all you were asked to do, was simply provide scientific
research refuting the work of Olney. I don't think the original poster sought

    INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language
courses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and 
Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses 
each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin 
June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours 
per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  
Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact 
Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology
Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or
address below.  
ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.

            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new
program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon 
University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific 
communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and 
January 1994.


PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the 
United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers
experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is 
facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and
laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop
long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.


PROGRAM DESIGN
To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to 
develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and
its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:

1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE
Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses
designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a
relatively short time.

2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE
A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the
cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in 
manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a 
variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,
Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums
will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or 
research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.


3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN
Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, 
participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,
and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan
will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.


FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS
STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of
the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting
any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though ""accepted"", may
not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick
buck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is
significantly inflated by these ""quacks of a different color"".  In fact, I'd
say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the
true focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus
on these ""quacks"" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search-and-
destroy-missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-
traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients
that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.


***************************************************
Now to make a general comment on many recent posts:
***************************************************

Lately I've seen the word ""quack"" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or
doctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical
subject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say ""quack-quack"" and
somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over
on their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach
you in medical school - how to throw your authority around?

Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  ""quack"" is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.
The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming
from any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real
scary.

But what do I know, I've already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this
newsgroup as being 'anal retentive', and 'psychotic'.  I look forward to more
net.diagnoses.  Hey, they're free.


Jon ""Quacks 'R Us"" Noring


(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories, such as the ""yeast theory"", should create your own moderated group.
You can call it sci.med.traditional.moderated or sci.med.AMA-approved, so you
can keep anal-retentives like me out of it.)

The burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence
of this ""syndrome"".  To date, these claims are unsubstantiated
by any available data.  Hopefully, as a scientist, you would
take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based
upon their data.

Gee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about
myself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice of
medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for
basing therapy than ""Aunt Susie's brother-in-law ..."".

Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis,
but rarely proves anything in a positive sense.  And unlike
mathematics, boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical
issues, and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually
disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease.

I would characterize it not as 'abject disbelief' but rather 
'scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions'.

I have no problem with such an approach; but this is NOT what
is happening in the 'trenches' of this diagnosis.

Hi,

we are just completing a project on nebuliser performance, and have a
wealth of data on particle size and output which we are going to use
to adjudicate a contract next week.

Although the output data is easy for us to present, there seems to be
little concensus on the optimum diameter of the nebulised droplets for
straightforward inhalation therapy (eg: for asthmatics).

Some say that the droplets must be smaller than 5 microns, whilst
others say that if they are too small they will not be effective.

Anyone up on this topic who could summarise the current status ?

Cheers,
Pete

As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager 
I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with 
the results.  The catalog description is as follows:

	The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager 
	that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a
	professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two
	counter-rotating ""thumbs"" that move in one-inch orbits --
	releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.

	Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109

To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or
fax at 1-800-345-4021.

********
NOTE:
When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price
was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog
enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  
QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,
and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it
looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the
first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a
reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to
ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could 
use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old 
one.  VERY reasonable people.
********

I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I 
would be described as ""structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches 
and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  
If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough
time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, 
more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require 
physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit 
to get the prescription for p.t.  

The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache
(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my 
physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles 
in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the 
headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to 
while it is being massaged.

I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing
someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my 
neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in 
the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient 
p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up 
in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.

I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base
unit is about a 14"" x 9"" rectangle, about 3-3/4"" high, with handles on each
side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal ""thumbs"" are about 
1-1/2"" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2"" above the base.  The thumbs 
are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more 
toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in 
either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side 
of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either
side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck
or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.

For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if 
laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or 
neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or
standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are
also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I 
don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works 
well for me.

For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager
behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or
not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  
If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches 
whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use 
than the commonly used ""home-made"" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together 
(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and 
move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than 
nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are 
not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't 
pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this 
is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple 
considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.

Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion 
for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my
neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard
against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a
few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  
After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, 
the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  
I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the 
most vulnerable point for me.

It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,
although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at
a time) to really work it out.

I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I
cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had
it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also 
to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have
been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this 
was very timely  for me.

This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently
became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been
in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,
while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog
products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought
put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones
I've seen such as ""Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog"" or ""Mature Wisdom"".
I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no
big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, 
particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.

I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would 
like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

Not that new.  20 years ago, we had drug addicts harboring active TB
that was resistant to everything (in Chicago).  The difference now
is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such
TB was weak.  It didn't spread to other people very easily and just
infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance
with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains
has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9
drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to
such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we
are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary
even if they entail force.

If you culture out the spirochete, it is virtually 100% certain
the patient has Lyme.  I suppose you could have contamination
in an exceptionally sloppy lab, but normally not.  There are no
false positives.

I had a similar reaction to Chinese food but came to a completly different
conclusion. I've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems. I went
with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest. and they ordered
lots of stuff I had never seen before. The only thing I can remember of that
meal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce.
I thought, ""Well, I've only had scallops once and I was sick after but that
could have been a coincidence"". That night as I sat on the bathroom floor,
sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, I decided I would never touch
another scallop. I may not be allergic but I don't want to take the chance.

To construct a Kirlian device find a copy of _Handbook of Psychic
Discoveries_ by Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder 1975 Library of
Congress 73-88532.  It describes the necessary equipment and
 suppliers for the Tesla coil or alternatives, the copper plate and
setup. I used a pack of SX-70 film and removed a single pack in a
dark room, then made the exposure, put it back in the film pack and
ran it out through the rollers of the camera forinstant developing
and very high quality.  It is a good way to experience what Kirlian
Photography is really and what it is not.  As you know all ready,
it is the pattern in the bioplasmic energy fieldthat is significant.
Variations caused by exposure time, distance from the plate, or
pressure on the plate, or variations in the photo materials are not
important.

No, there's no evidence that would convince any but the most credulous.

The ""evidence"" is identical to the sort of evidence that has been
used to justify all sorts of quack treatments for quack diseases
in the past.

I like the implication here.  It must not be that the quacks making
millions off such ""diseases"" are biased -- rather that those who
doubt their existence don't understand the real world.  It seems
easy to picture a 19th centure snake oil salesman saying the same
thing.

However, I have been in the trenches long enough to have seen multiple
quack diseases rise and fall in popularity.  ""Systemic yeast syndome""
seems to be making a resurgence (it had fallen off a few years ago).
There will be new such ""diseases"" I'm sure with best-selling books
and expensive therapies.

If this theory were true, the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy
(evidence of acute loss of enlarged motor units); it doesn't.
Instead, the biopsy shows scattered, angulated, atrophic fibers.
This is more consistent with load-shedding by chronically overworked
motor neurons - the neurons survive, at the expense of increasingly
denervated muscle.

Hello,

I am planning on attending Podiatry School next year.

I have narrowed my choices to the Pennsylvania College of Podiatric
Medicine, in Philadelphia, or the California College of Podiatric
Medicine in San Francisco.  

If anyone has any information or oppinions about these two schools, please
tell me.  I am having a hard time deciding which one to attend, and must
make a decision very soon.

Where did you read this?  I don't think this is true.  I think most
medical treatments are based on science, although it is difficult
to prove anything with certitude.  It is true that there are some
things that have just been found ""to work"", but we have no good
explanation for why.  But almost everything does have a scientific
rationale.  The most common treatment for prostate cancer is
probably hormone therapy.  It has been ""proven"" to work.  So have
radiation and chemotherapy.  What treatments did the article say
are not proven?

Hi all,

My skin is very dry in general. But the most serious part is located
from knees down. The skin there looks like segmented. The segmentation
actually happens beneath the skin. I would like to know if there is any
cure for this.

At the supermarkets or pharmacies, there are quite a lot of stuffs for
dry skins, but what to chose?

Thanks in advance for all advices and hints.

A friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post
the following information.

A few weeks ago, she noticed that some of her hair was starting
to fall out.  She would touch her head and strands of hair would
just fall right out. (by the way, she is 29 or 30 years old).  
It continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the
size of a half dollar.  Since that time, she  has gotten two
more bald spots of the same size.  Other symptoms she's
described include:  several months of an irregular menstrual
cycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been
extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake
up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day
it's fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that she's had 4 or 5
very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that
knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.

She went to a dermatologist first who couldn't find any reason
for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected
thyroid problems.  He did the blood work and claims that everything
came back normal.  

She's very concerned and very confused.  Does anyone have any
ideas or suggestions?  I told her that I thought she should
see an endocrinologist.  Does that sound like the right idea?

** By the way, in case you are going to ask...no, she has recently
taken any medications that would cause these symptoms...no, she hasn't
recently changed her hair products and she hasn't gotten a perm, 
coloring, or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall
out.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Candida albicans can cause severe life-threatening infections, usually
in people who are otherwise quite ill.  This is not, however, the sort
of illness that you are probably discussing.

""Systemic yeast syndrome"" where the body is allergic to
yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine.  There
is a book ""The Yeast Connection"" which talks about this ""illness"".

There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists.

Yes, but typically they *don't*.  Not every wild flight of fancy serves
(or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis.  It is
somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an
example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about
Kekule.  Surely, there must be others.  But apparently this is regarded
as an *extreme* example of a ""non-rational"" process in science whereby
a successful hypothesis was proposed.  But how non-rational is it?

Of course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or why
Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails.
Surely it wasn't the *only* daydream he had.  What was special about
*this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived
*analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning
geometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning ""extra-scientific""?
Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perice's notion of abduction,
the use of models within and across disciplines)?  Upon close examination,
is there a non-rational mystical leap taking place, or is it perhaps
closer to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model?

Short of changes by the feds, there is no way.  Codeine alone is very
difficult to prescribe without a lot of hassles.  Tylenol #3 is the
best compromise.  That way he can get refills.  The amount of acetominophen
he is getting with his codeine won't hurt him any.

>>>Can men get yeast infections? Spread them? What kind of symptoms?

My ENT doctor told me that it is not uncommon for the wife to get a vaginal
yeast infection after the husband takes antibiotics.  In fact this recently
happened to my wife.  Explanation is that the antibiotics kill the yeast's
competition, they then thrive and increased yeast around the penis spread
the infection during intercourse.  I was on ceclor for 30 days, then my wife
got the yeast.

Umm, weren't you the one objecting to someone who is a ""licensed
physician"" being called a quack?  Or is it just that being a licensed
physician is a good defense against charges of quackery when the
physician agrees with your system of beliefs?

>Lately I've seen the word ""quack"" bandied about recklessly.

Actually, I almost never use the term quack.  When I discuss
""systemic yeast syndrome"", however, I always point out that
mainstream medicine views this as a quack diagnosis (and I agree
with that characterization).

>Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  ""quack"" is a nebulous word
>lacking in any precision.

Really?  I bet virtually everyone reading these posts understands what
Steve Dyer, Gordon Banks, and I am implying when we have talked about
systemic yeast syndrome as a quack diagnosis.  Would you prefer the
word ""charlatan""?  (I don't happen to think that all quacks are
charlatans since I suspect that some believe in the ""diseases"" they
are diagnosing.)

>(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on
>the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and

Why?  Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldn't be pointed out
in SCI.med that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the 
existence of systemic yeast syndrome?

Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.  You just have to do the

If you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about

rare. Even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that
they do now.

(Disclaimer: I'm a sufferer, not a doctor.)

I'm not sure there's a really sharp distinction between allergic and
vasomotor rhinitis.  Basically, vasomotor rhinitis means your nose is
stuffy when it has no reason to be (not even an identifiable allergy).

Decongestants and steroid sprays work for vasomotor rhinitis.  Also,
I can get surprising relief from purely superficial measures such as
saline moisturizing spray and moisturizing gel.
